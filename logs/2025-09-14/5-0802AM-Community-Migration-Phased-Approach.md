## Data Migration Strategy

### **From Playground to Production**
**Component Migration:**
- Extract playground UI components to `/components/community/`
- Replace mock data with TanStack Query hooks
- Integrate form state management for all inputs
- Add server action calls for all mutations

**Data Seeding:**
- Convert playground mock data to database seeds
- Instructor will populate initial posts and discussions
- Seed initial achievements and success stories
- Create realistic goal progression examples

### **Architecture Compliance Validation**
**3-Layer Distribution Verification:**
- No data mixing between TanStack Query, form state, and Zustand
- Clear ownership boundaries for each data type
- Server actions handle all mutations and security
- Components read from appropriate layer only

**Answer**: Quiz results during watching those videos, and grading the reflection quality that users provide. Each video should have a learn rate. Each course should combine all learn rates from all videos of that course. Videos that are longer should have higher weight in terms of learn rate calculation of the entire course. Learn rate of a user in achieving a goal will be the learn rate of all courses combined in that goal. Learn rate calculation from courses is dependent on, is calculated based on the learn rate of individual courses. And it should combine the learn rate of individual courses and the courses that are bigger should have a higher weight in determining the overall learn rate.

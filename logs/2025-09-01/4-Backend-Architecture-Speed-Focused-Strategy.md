# Backend Architecture: Speed-to-Market Strategy
**Date:** September 1, 2025  
**Goal:** Launch ASAP with robust, scalable architecture  
**Stack:** Supabase + Backblaze B2 + Bunny.net CDN

---

## 🎯 Core Principle: Speed Without Sacrifice

**The Mantra:** Build fast, but build right. Every shortcut today is tomorrow's technical debt.

---

## 📐 Architecture Principles for Rapid Development

### 1. **Database-First Development**
Start with Supabase schema design. The database IS your backend. Supabase provides instant APIs from your tables - no manual endpoint writing needed. Design tables correctly upfront and you get REST APIs, real-time subscriptions, and authentication for free.

### 2. **Leverage Platform Services**
Don't build what you can buy. Supabase handles auth, Backblaze handles storage, Bunny handles CDN. Your job is orchestration, not infrastructure. Every hour spent on infrastructure is an hour not spent on features.

### 3. **Edge Functions Over Traditional APIs**
Use Supabase Edge Functions for custom logic. They deploy instantly, scale automatically, and integrate seamlessly with your database. No servers to manage, no containers to orchestrate.

### 4. **Storage Strategy: Separation of Concerns**
Videos go to Backblaze B2 (cheap storage), served through Bunny.net CDN (fast delivery). Database stores only metadata and URLs. Never store binary data in Supabase - it's expensive and slow.

### 5. **Authentication as Foundation**
Supabase Auth provides the user ID that connects everything. Every table should have user_id foreign key with Row Level Security (RLS). This gives you automatic data isolation without writing permission checks.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture Concepts

### **The Three-Layer Model**

**Layer 1: Data Foundation (Supabase)**
This is your source of truth. Users, courses, progress, enrollments - all structured data lives here. Supabase gives you instant CRUD operations, real-time updates, and built-in auth. Design your schema to match your domain types exactly.

**Layer 2: Media Pipeline (Backblaze + Bunny)**
Videos upload directly to Backblaze using presigned URLs - never touch your server. Bunny.net pulls from Backblaze on-demand and caches globally. Users stream from the nearest edge location, not your origin.

**Layer 3: Business Logic (Edge Functions)**
Complex operations like enrollment workflows, payment processing, and AI interactions happen in Edge Functions. These are stateless, scalable, and deploy in seconds. Keep them small and focused.

## 🚀 Speed Optimization Strategies

### **Week 1: Foundation Sprint**

**Day 1-2: Schema and Auth**
Create all tables at once. Don't iterate - design completely then execute. Enable RLS policies immediately. Set up social auth providers (Google, GitHub) for instant user onboarding.

**Day 3-4: Media Pipeline**
Configure Backblaze buckets with lifecycle rules. Set up Bunny pull zones with proper cache headers. Create Edge Function for presigned upload URLs. Test video upload and playback end-to-end.

**Day 5: Core APIs**
Enable Supabase auto-generated APIs. Create database views for complex queries. Set up Edge Functions only for operations that can't be done with straight database queries.

### **Week 2: Integration Sprint**

**Day 6-7: Frontend Connection**
Update environment variables to point to Supabase. Start with auth - once user IDs flow, everything else follows. Replace mock services one at a time, testing each.

**Day 8-9: Video Features**
Implement progress tracking using Supabase real-time. Store watch history, bookmarks, and completion status. Use database triggers for automatic calculations.

**Day 10: AI Integration**
Create Edge Function for OpenAI calls. Store conversation history in database. Implement token counting and rate limiting at database level using triggers.

### **Week 3: Polish Sprint**

Focus on what users see: smooth video playback, instant page loads, reliable progress saving. Performance perception matters more than actual performance.

## 💡 Architectural Decisions for Speed

### **What to Build**
- Database schema (complete and correct)
- RLS policies (security from day one)
- Edge Functions for complex workflows
- Upload presigning logic
- Payment webhook handlers

### **What NOT to Build**
- Custom authentication system (use Supabase Auth)
- Video transcoding pipeline (use Backblaze + Bunny)
- Email service (use Resend via Edge Functions)
- File upload handling (direct to Backblaze)
- Caching layer (Bunny.net handles this)

### **What to Defer**
- Advanced analytics (add PostHog later)
- Recommendation engine (manual curation first)
- Real-time collaboration (use basic comments first)
- Mobile apps (PWA is enough initially)
- Microservices (monolithic Edge Functions are fine)

## 🏃 Speed Hacks for Launch

### **Database Design Shortcuts**

**Denormalization for Speed**
Store calculated values (completion percentage, total watch time) directly in tables. Use database triggers to keep them updated. Trading storage for computation speed is worth it.

**Materialized Views**
Create views for complex queries that frontend needs. Refresh them periodically. The frontend gets simple queries, you get performance.

**JSON Columns for Flexibility**
Use JSONB columns for data that might change structure (user preferences, course metadata). Migrate to proper columns later when patterns emerge.

### **Frontend Integration Patterns**

**Optimistic Updates**
Update UI immediately, sync with database async. Users perceive instant response. Roll back on failure (rare).

**Partial Data Loading**
Load course list first, details on demand. Show skeletons while loading. Progressive enhancement over complete loading.

**Client-Side Caching**
Keep last 10 viewed items in localStorage. Instant back navigation. Sync on focus return.

## 🔐 Security Without Slowdown

### **Row Level Security (RLS)**
Every table gets RLS from day one. Users can only see their data. Instructors can only edit their courses. This is enforced at database level - unhackable from frontend.

### **API Rate Limiting**
Use Supabase built-in rate limiting. Set generous limits initially, tighten based on usage patterns. Prevent abuse without hindering legitimate use.

### **Content Security**
Videos served from CDN with signed URLs that expire. No direct Backblaze access. Bunny.net token authentication prevents hotlinking.

---

## 📊 Monitoring for Speed

### **What to Track**
- Time to first video frame (critical for perception)
- API response times (P95, not average)
- Database query performance (slow query log)
- CDN cache hit ratio (should be >90%)
- User drop-off points (where they leave)

### **What to Ignore (Initially)**
- Perfect code coverage
- Microservice boundaries
- Container orchestration
- Multi-region deployment
- Advanced caching strategies

---

- 2GB bandwidth (metadata only, not videos)
- 50,000 auth users (plenty for launch)

### **Backblaze B2**
- First 10GB free
- $0.005/GB storage (500 hours of video = $50/month)
- Egress to Bunny.net is free (Bandwidth Alliance)

### **Bunny.net CDN**
- $0.01/GB bandwidth (cheapest tier)
- 1TB = $10 (enough for 1000 users watching 10 hours each)
- No minimum commitment

**Total Infrastructure Cost: <$100/month for first 1000 users**

## 📝 Key Decisions for Speed

### **Choose Boring Technology**
PostgreSQL, not MongoDB. REST, not GraphQL. Server components, not complex state. Boring equals fast, predictable, and debuggable.

### **Embrace Constraints**
Supabase's limitations are features. They prevent over-engineering. Work within the platform, not against it.

### **Ship on Friday, Fix on Monday**
Perfect is the enemy of launched. Ship when core works, iterate based on real feedback. Users are more forgiving than you think.

### **Document Nothing (Initially)**
Code should be self-documenting. API should be intuitive. Save documentation for post-launch. Time spent writing docs is time not spent shipping.

---

## ⚡ The Fast Path Forward

**Stop planning, start building.** You have enough information. The frontend is ready. The stack is chosen. Every day of delay is a day competitors get ahead.

**Build the database schema today.** Everything else follows from that. Once data structure is right, the rest is just CRUD operations and business logic.

**Launch with 20% of features.** Users will tell you which 80% to build next. Building features nobody uses is the slowest possible path.

**Speed is a feature.** Users prefer a fast, simple product over a slow, complex one. Optimize for time-to-value, not feature completeness.

---

## 💭 Final Thought

The best architecture is the one that ships. The fastest backend is the one you don't build. Use platforms, embrace constraints, and focus relentlessly on what matters: getting your product into users' hands.

Every feature you don't build is a feature that can't break. Every service you don't run is a service that can't go down. Every line of code you don't write is a line you don't have to maintain.

**Launch fast. Learn faster. Iterate fastest.**

The market doesn't care about your architecture. Users don't care about your code quality. Investors don't care about your test coverage.

They care about one thing: **Does it solve the problem?**

Everything else is just engineering ego.

**Ship it.**

# Refactoring Execution Plan
**Date**: 2025-08-31
**Time**: 08:19 AM EST
**Purpose**: Step-by-step execution plan for safe architectural refactoring

## Pre-Execution Requirements

### Verification Checklist
Before starting ANY refactoring, verify and document that:
- Video playback controls work (play, pause, seek)
- Manual pause shows hint agent
- Agent buttons (Hint, Quiz, Reflect, Path) switch correctly
- "Let's go" activates agents
- Quiz completion resumes video after countdown
- Reflection saves and video resumes
- Segment in/out points work
- Chat maintains video context
- Instructor view shows student activities

### Environment Setup
- Create a test branch from current working state
- Document current commit hash as known-good state
- Set up ability to test in both student and instructor modes
- Have browser dev tools ready for console monitoring

**Verification**: Have complete list of components to migrate

**Rollback**: No changes to rollback

### Step 3.2: Migrate First Leaf Component
**Action**: Update simplest component to use adapter
- Choose component with minimal video state usage
- Replace direct store access with adapter
- Test all component functionality

**Verification**: Component works identically with adapter

**Rollback**: Revert component to original implementation

### Step 3.3: Migrate Video Controls
**Action**: Update video control components
- Migrate play/pause button components
- Migrate seek bar component
- Migrate volume control component

**Verification**: All controls work as before

**Rollback**: Revert each component individually

### Step 3.4: Migrate Video Player Components
**Action**: Update main video player components
- Start with VideoEngine
- Then VideoPlayer
- Then StudentVideoPlayer
- Finally StudentVideoPlayerV2

**Verification**: Video playback works completely

**Rollback**: Revert components in reverse order

## Phase 4: State Machine Integration (Day 11-13)
**Goal**: Connect AI agent system to new architecture

### Step 4.1: Update Video Controller
**Action**: Modify VideoController to use adapter
- Replace direct store access with adapter calls
- Maintain all existing method signatures
- Keep fallback mechanisms intact

**Verification**: 
- AI agents still appear on pause
- Agent switching works
- Video resumes after countdown

**Rollback**: Revert VideoController changes

### Step 4.2: Update State Machine Store Access
**Action**: Modify state machine store interactions
- Identify all points where state machine accesses store
- Replace with adapter or explicit dependencies
- Maintain exact same behavior

**Verification**: All agent interactions work correctly

**Rollback**: Revert state machine changes

### Step 4.3: Test Agent System Thoroughly
**Action**: Comprehensive agent system testing
- Test each agent type individually
- Test switching between agents
- Test video resume scenarios
- Test recording mode with agents

**Verification**: Complete agent test checklist passes

**Rollback**: Revert to last known good state

## Phase 5: State Migration (Day 14-16)
**Goal**: Move state to correct slices

### Step 5.1: Migrate Universal State
**Action**: Move universal video state to VideoSlice
- Move currentTime, isPlaying, duration, volume
- Update adapter to use VideoSlice
- Keep StudentVideoSlice as fallback

**Verification**: Video playback unaffected

**Rollback**: Revert adapter to use StudentVideoSlice

### Step 5.2: Migrate Segment State
**Action**: Move segment state to VideoSegmentSlice
- Move inPoint, outPoint, segment methods
- Update components using segment state
- Test segment selection thoroughly

**Verification**: Segment selection works correctly

- Midday: Assess progress and issues
- Evening: Document findings and blockers

### Go/No-Go Decision Points
- End of Phase 1: Foundation stable?
- End of Phase 3: Components working?
- End of Phase 4: Agents functioning?
- End of Phase 5: State migration successful?

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Operations
- State machine modifications
- Video controller changes
- Store restructuring

### Mitigation Strategies
- Test in isolation first

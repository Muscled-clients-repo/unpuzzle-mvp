# Enrollment to Goal-Based Access Migration Plan

**Date**: September 17, 2025 - 7:48 PM
**Purpose**: Comprehensive migration from traditional enrollment terminology to goal-based access model
**Priority**: High - Core architectural alignment
**Impact**: System-wide language and conceptual updates

---

## Executive Summary

The Unpuzzle MVP system currently uses outdated enrollment terminology that conflicts with its implemented goal-based access architecture. This migration plan outlines the systematic replacement of enrollment concepts with goal-based access language to achieve:

- **Architectural Alignment**: Language matches actual implementation
- **User Experience Clarity**: Clear understanding of automatic course access
- **Scalability**: Simplified mental model for future development
- **Community Focus**: Emphasis on shared learning goals rather than individual enrollment

---

## Current State Analysis

### Terminology Conflicts
The system currently mixes enrollment language with goal-based functionality, creating confusion:

- Functions named `getEnrolledCourses()` that actually fetch goal-based courses
- UI text referring to "enrollment" when access is automatic
- Service methods suggesting manual enrollment processes
- Variable names implying enrollment state management

### Implementation Reality
The actual system architecture already implements goal-based access:

- Students assigned to goals via `profiles.current_goal_id`
- Courses linked to goals through `course_goal_assignments`
- Automatic access based on goal matching
- No manual enrollment processes in core functionality

### User Experience Impact
Current terminology creates misleading expectations:

- Users expect enrollment buttons that don't exist
- Confusion about how course access works
- Unclear relationship between goals and course availability
- Mixed messaging about community vs individual access

---

## Target State Vision

### Goal-Based Access Model
Clear language that reflects the actual system architecture:

- **Course Access**: Automatic based on assigned learning goals
- **Community Learning**: Students with same goals see same courses
- **Dynamic Access**: Goal changes instantly update course availability
- **Administrative Control**: Admins assign courses to goals, not individual enrollments

### Language Principles
All terminology should emphasize:

1. **Automatic Access**: No manual enrollment required
2. **Goal Alignment**: Access tied to learning objectives
3. **Community Focus**: Shared experiences within goal groups
4. **Immediate Availability**: Real-time access updates

### User Mental Model
Students should understand:

- Goals determine course access automatically
- Changing goals changes available courses
- All students with same goal see same content
- No enrollment buttons or processes needed

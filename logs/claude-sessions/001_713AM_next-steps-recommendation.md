SELFDOC: what should we do next regarding unpuzzle mvp
```

## Assistant Response

Looking at our current position in the Unpuzzle MVP development, here's what we should do next:

## Recommendation: Start Increment 1 - Basic Authentication

Based on our documented plan (files 4, 5, 5a), we're ready to begin backend development. The most logical next step is **Increment 1: Basic Authentication with Supabase**.

### Why This Makes Sense Now:
1. **Frontend is ready** - Login/signup UI completed
2. **Blockers removed** - Mock data override fixed, crash prevention done
3. **Clear implementation plan** - File 5a has detailed steps
4. **Foundation for everything else** - Can't build courses/lessons without real users

### What Increment 1 Would Involve:
1. **Supabase Setup** (30 min)
   - Create project
   - Get API keys
   - Configure environment variables

2. **Database Schema** (1 hour)
   - Users table (handled by Supabase Auth)
   - Profiles table (name, avatar, role)
   - Subscriptions table (plan type, status)

3. **Auth Integration** (2-3 hours)
   - Connect signup form to Supabase
   - Connect login form to Supabase
   - Implement logout
   - Add session persistence

4. **Replace Hardcoded IDs** (1-2 hours)
   - Find all "user-1" references
   - Update to use real user IDs
   - Test data isolation

5. **RLS Policies** (1 hour)
   - Secure profiles table
   - Secure subscriptions table
   - Test access control

### Alternative Options:
- **Option B**: Do more frontend polish (but we have enough for MVP)
- **Option C**: Start with video infrastructure (but need users first)
- **Option D**: Build course CRUD (but need auth to know who owns what)

### My Recommendation:
**Start with Increment 1 now**. It's the smallest, most critical piece that unlocks everything else. Once we have real users logging in, we can incrementally add courses, lessons, and videos on top of that foundation.

Should we proceed with setting up Supabase and implementing basic authentication?

# Video Editor - Playback & Scrubber Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Play From Scrubber Position
**Problem**: When scrubber was moved and play clicked, video didn't play from that position
**Solution**: Sync video currentTime with scrubber position before playing
```typescript
// VideoEditorCommands.ts
const scrubberPosition = snapshot.context.timeline.scrubber.position
if (scrubberPosition !== this.playbackService.currentTime) {
  this.playbackService.seek(scrubberPosition)
}
```

### 2. ✅ Auto-Reset When Video Ends
**Problem**: Scrubber stayed at end when video finished, play button didn't work
**Solution**: Reset to beginning when video ends or when play is clicked at end
```typescript
// PlaybackService.ts
if (this.videoElement.ended || this.videoElement.currentTime >= this.videoElement.duration) {
  this.videoElement.currentTime = 0
  this.eventBus.emit('playback.seek', { time: 0 })
}
```

### 3. ✅ Scrubber Reset on Video End
**Problem**: Scrubber position wasn't resetting when video ended
**Solution**: Added event handler for video ended event
```typescript
// PlaybackService.ts
this.videoElement.addEventListener('ended', () => {
  this.videoElement!.currentTime = 0
  this.eventBus.emit('playback.ended', { currentTime: 0 })
})
```

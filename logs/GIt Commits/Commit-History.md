**Message:** docs: add comprehensive route and component analysis documentation

**Details:**
- **Documentation Created:**
  - Complete route list with actual example URLs for all 34 routes

  - Fixed instructor course routes to use numeric IDs (/instructor/course/1/analytics)
  - Documented lesson routes use lesson-prefixed IDs (/instructor/lesson/lesson-1/analytics)
  - Student routes keep course-prefixed IDs (/student/course/course-1/video/1)

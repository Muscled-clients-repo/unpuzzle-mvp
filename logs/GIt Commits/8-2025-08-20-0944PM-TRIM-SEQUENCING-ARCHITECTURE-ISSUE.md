## Commit: feat: Multi-clip playback works, trim sequencing needs architecture redesign

**Hash**: 393132c  
**Date**: August 20, 2025  
**Branch**: instructor-video-studio  

### Summary
Implemented Option A (Clip Sequence Pre-calculation) for video editor, achieving working multi-clip playback but identified fundamental architectural limitations with trimmed clip sequencing.

### What Works ✅
- Multi-clip recording and playback fully functional
- Record, pause, play controls operational
- Timeline and scrubber interaction works for single clips
- Clip splitting/trimming creates segments correctly
- Basic video playback between different source recordings

### Known Issues ⚠️
**Trimmed Clip Sequencing has Architectural Limitations:**
- Scrubber and preview panel sync issues during trimmed playback
- Current approach uses multiple video elements with manual coordination
- Attempting to juggle multiple videos in real-time causes edge cases
- Competitors solve this by processing edits at edit-time, not playback-time

### Technical Implementation

#### Option A: Clip Sequence Pre-calculation
```javascript
// Calculate complete playback sequence when play starts
function calculateClipSequence(clips, startPosition) {
  const sortedClips = [...clips].sort((a, b) => a.startTime - b.startTime)
  const sequence = sortedClips.slice(startClipIndex)
  return { sequence, startIndex: 0 }
}
```

#### OutPoint Monitoring for Trimmed Clips
```javascript
// Monitor when trimmed clips reach their outPoint
if (currentTime >= currentClip.outPoint - 0.05) {
  stateMachine.send({ type: 'VIDEO.ENDED' })
}
```

#### Smart Video Reuse
```javascript
// Reuse video for sequential trimmed segments from same source
if (currentBaseId === nextBaseId && sameSourceUrl) {
  canSkipLoad = true
}
```

### Architecture Analysis

#### Current Approach (Problematic)
```
Play → Load Video 1 → Seek → Monitor → Switch → Load Video 2 → Seek → Monitor
         ↑                      ↑                     ↑
      Complex              Race Condition         Timing Issues
```

#### Better Approach (Industry Standard)
```
Edit → Process → Single Output → Simple Playback
         ↑              ↑              ↑
    One-time cost   Clean blob    Just play()
```

### Recommended Solutions

1. **FFmpeg.wasm** - Process edits into single video blob
2. **MediaRecorder API** - Combine clips via canvas recording
3. **Media Source Extensions (MSE)** - Stream segments as single source
4. **MP4Box.js** - Efficient segment extraction and combination

### Files Modified
- `src/lib/video-editor/VideoEditorSingleton.ts` - Integration layer with Option A fixes
- `src/lib/video-editor/state-machine/VideoEditorMachineV5.ts` - Clip sequence pre-calculation
- `src/lib/video-editor/queries/VideoEditorQueries.ts` - Fixed record button availability
- `src/lib/video-editor/services/PlaybackService.ts` - Blob URL validation improvements
- `src/lib/video-editor/services/TimelineService.ts` - Timeline management

### Logs Created
- `logs/2025-08-19/deep-root-cause-analysis-trim-playback.md` - Complete analysis
- `logs/2025-08-19/7-0700PM-OPTION-A-INTEGRATION-LAYER-FIX-PLAN.md` - Fix plan

### Next Steps
Consider implementing edit-time processing instead of playback-time coordination:
- Process trims when user finishes editing (not during playback)
- Create single video blob from all edits
- Use simple video.play() for playback

### Merge Resolution
**Commit**: 7d68ad9 - Merge branch 'instructor-video-studio' - Keep Option A implementation
- Resolved conflicts by keeping Option A implementation over remote changes
- Preserved clip sequence pre-calculation approach
- Maintained outPoint monitoring for trimmed clips

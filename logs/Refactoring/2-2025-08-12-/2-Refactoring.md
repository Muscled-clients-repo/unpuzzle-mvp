We just did refactoring and all the work is in the refactoring folder -> 1-2025-08-12 folder.

Now i want to do a codebase audit one more time to ensure:
1. we're doing things the zustnad way
2. we dont have any bloated, conflicted, contradicting, non-best practice code in our code base
3. Codebase is ready for supaend backend integration.

Do a comprehensive analysis of the entire codebase and update this file with your findings about security issues, non best practices, issues that might hinder us to build on this app furhther down the line with more features, adding more interactivity, etc.

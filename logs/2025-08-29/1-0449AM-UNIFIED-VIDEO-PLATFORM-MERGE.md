# Unified Video Platform Merge - Video Editor + AI Agents
**Date:** August 29, 2025, 4:49 AM EST  
**Branch:** video-editor-with-ai-agents  
**Commit:** 639afba

## Summary
Successfully merged video editor timeline features with AI learning assistant agents into a unified platform.

## Problem Solved
- Video editor features (timeline, trim, multi-track) were on `video-editor-v2` branch
- AI learning agents (hint, quiz, reflect, path) were on `migrate-v2-video-player-student-courses` branch
- Need both feature sets in a single working branch

## Branches Involved
1. **Source Branch 1:** `video-editor-v2` (commit 8cb308a)
   - Timeline editing with multi-track support
   - Drag-and-drop clip positioning
   - Trim functionality with handles
   - Frame-based architecture (30 FPS)
   - Virtual Timeline Engine

2. **Source Branch 2:** `migrate-v2-video-player-student-courses` (commit e5faa96)
   - 4 AI learning agents
   - Interactive chat sidebar
   - Quiz system with feedback
   - Reflection tools (voice, screenshot, Loom)
   - State machine for agent interactions

## Merge Process
1. Created new branch `video-editor-with-ai-agents` from AI agents branch
2. Merged video-editor-v2 using fast-forward (no conflicts)
3. Restored video-agent-system directory (was deleted in merge)
4. Fixed untracked file issues from branch switching

## Technical Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: Untracked File Conflict
- **Problem:** Created `video-agent-system.ts` file on commit 6e25e06 to fix build
- **Impact:** File persisted after branch switch, overriding directory structure
- **Solution:** Removed untracked file to expose correct directory implementation

### Issue 2: Missing Video Agent System
- **Problem:** Merge deleted video-agent-system directory
- **Solution:** Restored from source branch using `git checkout migrate-v2-video-player-student-courses -- src/lib/video-agent-system`

## Final Result

### Working Routes
- **Video Editor:** `/instructor/studio`
  - Full timeline editing capabilities
  - Multi-track support
  - Recording features
  
- **AI Learning Assistant:** `/student/course/course-1/video/1`
  - All 4 agents functional
  - Chat sidebar with video sync
  - Quiz and reflection systems

### Key Features Combined
- ✅ Timeline editing with trim, drag-and-drop
- ✅ Multi-track video/audio support
- ✅ AI hint, quiz, reflect, path agents
- ✅ Interactive learning with video playback
- ✅ Recording capabilities (screen/camera)
- ✅ Voice memo and screenshot reflections

## Files Changed
- 16 files changed, 4,371 insertions
- Restored video-agent-system directory structure
- No merge conflicts encountered

## Next Steps
- Test all features in unified platform
- Ensure no regression in either feature set
- Consider integration points between editor and AI agents

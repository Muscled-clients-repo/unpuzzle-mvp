# Phase 1-3 Implementation Complete ✅

**Date:** 2025-10-08
**Status:** Ready for Testing

## What Was Implemented

### Phase 1: Database Setup ✅

Created 3 new migration files:

#### 1. `119_community_posts_mvp.sql` - Community Posts with JSONB
- Single `community_posts` table with JSONB for likes/replies (MVP approach)
- Helper functions: `add_post_like()`, `remove_post_like()`, `add_post_reply()`
- Cached counts for performance (`likes_count`, `replies_count`)
- Full RLS policies
- GIN indexes for JSONB queries

#### 2. `120_global_resources_system.sql` - Global Resources
- `resources` table - main resource storage
- `resource_links` table - polymorphic junction (links to posts/videos/courses/conversations)
- `resource_interactions` table - combined downloads + ratings
- Helper functions: `record_resource_download()`, `record_resource_rating()`
- Automatic stats updates via triggers
- Full RLS policies

#### 3. `121_enhance_profiles_revenue_tracking.sql` - Revenue Tracking
- Added columns to `profiles` table:
  - `total_revenue_earned` (Agency Track - additive)
  - `current_mrr` (SaaS Track - GREATEST logic)
  - `goal_started_at`, `goal_completed_at`
  - `completed_goals` (UUID array)
  - `revenue_updated_at`
- Helper functions:
  - `update_user_revenue(user_id, track_type, amount)` - Updates revenue based on track
  - `mark_goal_completed(user_id, goal_id)` - Marks goal as complete
  - `has_completed_goal(user_id, goal_id)` - Check goal completion
  - `get_goal_progress(user_id)` - Get complete progress data
- Indexes for performance

### Phase 2: Backend Server Actions ✅

Created `/src/app/actions/revenue-actions.ts` with:

#### 1. `submitRevenueProof()`
- Student submits revenue amount + proof video URL
- Creates conversation message with metadata:
  ```typescript
  {
    message_type: 'revenue_submission',
    track_type: 'agency' | 'saas',
    submitted_amount: number,
    proof_video_url: string,
    status: 'pending',
    reviewed_by: null,
    reviewed_at: null,
    rejection_reason: null
  }
  ```
- Validates no duplicate pending submissions
- Revalidates `/student/goals` path

#### 2. `getLatestRevenueSubmission(conversationId)`
- Fetches the most recent submission for status checking
- Returns submission metadata including status

#### 3. `reviewRevenueSubmission(messageId, approved, rejectionReason?)`
- Instructor reviews submission (approve/reject)
- Updates message metadata with review decision
- If approved: calls `update_user_revenue()` RPC to update profile
- Revalidates both student and instructor paths

#### 4. `getUserRevenueProgress()`
- Gets current user's revenue progress
- Uses `get_goal_progress()` RPC
- Returns goal name, target, current amount, percentage

### Phase 3: Student UI ✅

#### 1. Created `RevenueSubmissionModal.tsx`
- Clean modal interface for submitting revenue proof
- Two inputs:
  - Amount (numeric, $)
  - Proof Video URL (Loom or iCloud link)
- Track-specific help text:
  - Agency: "Revenue Earned"
  - SaaS: "Current MRR - Last 30 days revenue"
- Form validation (amount > 0, valid URL)
- Loading states during submission
- Toast notifications for success/error

#### 2. Updated `CurrentGoalCard.tsx`
- Added revenue submission button near progress bar
- Dynamic button states based on submission status:
  - **No submission:** "Submit Revenue Proof" (blue)
  - **Pending:** "Under Review" (yellow, disabled)
  - **Approved:** "Last submission approved - Submit new proof" (green)
  - **Rejected:** "Resubmit Revenue Proof" (red)
- Fetches submission status on mount
- Re-fetches after successful submission
- Opens modal when button clicked
- Only shows when `conversationId` prop is provided

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migrations

```bash
cd /Users/mahtabalam/Desktop/Coding/Unpuzzle-MVP

# Check migration status
npx supabase db diff

# Apply migrations (if using Supabase CLI)
npx supabase db push

# OR manually run in Supabase SQL Editor:
# - 119_community_posts_mvp.sql
# - 120_global_resources_system.sql
# - 121_enhance_profiles_revenue_tracking.sql
```

### 2. Verify Database Tables

In Supabase SQL Editor, run:

```sql
-- Check new tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name IN ('community_posts', 'resources', 'resource_links', 'resource_interactions');

-- Check profiles columns
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'profiles'
AND column_name IN ('total_revenue_earned', 'current_mrr', 'goal_started_at', 'completed_goals', 'revenue_updated_at');

-- Check helper functions exist
SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_schema = 'public'
AND routine_name IN ('update_user_revenue', 'get_goal_progress', 'mark_goal_completed');
```

### 3. Test Student UI

Navigate to: `http://localhost:3001/student/goals`

**Prerequisites:**
- You must pass `conversationId` prop to `<CurrentGoalCard />`
- Check where CurrentGoalCard is used and add the prop

**Expected behavior:**
1. See "Submit Revenue Proof" button below progress bar
2. Click button → modal opens
3. Enter amount (e.g., 5000)
4. Enter proof URL (e.g., https://loom.com/share/test)
5. Click "Submit Proof"
6. Button changes to "Under Review" (yellow, disabled)
7. Toast notification shows success

### 4. Test Backend Functions (Optional)

In browser console or Supabase Edge Functions:

```typescript
// Test submission
const result = await submitRevenueProof({
  conversationId: 'your-conversation-id',
  amount: 5000,
  proofVideoUrl: 'https://loom.com/share/test',
  trackType: 'agency'
})
console.log(result)

// Test fetching status
const status = await getLatestRevenueSubmission('your-conversation-id')
console.log(status)
```

## Known Requirements for Testing

### You need to:

1. **Pass `conversationId` to CurrentGoalCard**
   - Find where `<CurrentGoalCard goal={...} />` is used
   - Add `conversationId={conversationId}` prop
   - The conversation ID should come from the goal conversation data

2. **Ensure track_goals table has revenue_target column**
   - The `get_goal_progress()` function expects `tg.revenue_target`
   - May need to add this column if it doesn't exist:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE track_goals ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS revenue_target DECIMAL(10,2);
   ```

3. **Ensure message_type enum includes 'revenue_submission'**
   - Check conversation_messages table constraint
   - May need to update:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE conversation_messages
   DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS conversation_messages_message_type_check;

   ALTER TABLE conversation_messages
   ADD CONSTRAINT conversation_messages_message_type_check
   CHECK (message_type IN ('daily_note', 'instructor_response', 'activity', 'milestone', 'revenue_submission'));
   ```

## Questions?

If anything doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check Supabase logs for RPC errors
3. Verify conversation_id is being passed correctly
4. Ensure user is authenticated and has active conversation

# Student Track Assignment Flow Implementation Plan

## Overview
Design and implement a comprehensive student track assignment system that allows students to select their learning path and receive filtered, personalized course recommendations aligned with their goals.

## Core Concepts

### Track Selection Philosophy
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Present tracks in digestible categories without overwhelming choice
- **Goal Alignment**: Connect track selection directly to student's stated goals
- **Flexibility**: Allow track changes while preserving progress and preferences
- **Guided Discovery**: Use questionnaire approach to recommend optimal tracks

### Filtering Intelligence
- **Multi-Dimensional Filtering**: Track + Goal + Skill Level + Time Commitment
- **Dynamic Recommendations**: Course suggestions update based on progress and preferences
- **Personalization Engine**: Learn from student interactions to improve recommendations
- **Content Freshness**: Prioritize recently updated and high-engagement courses

## File Organization

### Core Pages
- `src/app/student/track-selection/page.tsx` - Main track selection interface
- `src/app/student/track-selection/questionnaire/page.tsx` - Guided track recommendation
- `src/app/student/dashboard/page.tsx` - Enhanced with filtered course discovery

### Components Structure
```
src/components/student/track-selection/
├── TrackSelectionGrid.tsx          # Visual grid of available tracks
├── TrackCard.tsx                   # Individual track presentation

├── SkillLevelSelector.tsx          # Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced
├── TimeCommitmentSelector.tsx      # Hours per week preference
├── GoalTrackMatcher.tsx            # Goal-to-track recommendation engine
└── TrackProgressIndicator.tsx     # Show completion across tracks
```

### Questionnaire Components
```

├── QuestionnaireFlow.tsx           # Multi-step questionnaire container
├── QuestionCard.tsx                # Individual question presentation
├── ProgressIndicator.tsx           # Step progress visualization
├── SkillAssessment.tsx             # Current skill level evaluation
├── GoalPrioritization.tsx          # Rank goals by importance
└── RecommendationResults.tsx       # Present recommended tracks
```

### Course Discovery Components
```
src/components/student/course-discovery/

├── CourseRecommendationCard.tsx    # Enhanced course cards
├── LearningPathVisualization.tsx   # Show progression through track
├── CourseFilterPanel.tsx           # Advanced filtering options
├── RecommendationEngine.tsx        # Algorithm-based suggestions
└── ProgressBasedSuggestions.tsx    # Next course recommendations
```

### Data Layer
```
src/lib/actions/
├── track-actions.ts                # Track CRUD operations
├── student-track-assignment.ts     # Track assignment logic
├── course-recommendation.ts        # Recommendation algorithms
└── student-preferences.ts          # Preference management
```

### Database Integration
```
supabase/migrations/
├── 021_student_track_assignments.sql    # Track assignment relationships
├── 022_student_preferences.sql          # Preference storage
└── 023_course_recommendation_engine.sql # Recommendation tracking
```

## Architecture Principles

### State Management Strategy
- **Server State**: Track assignments, course progress, recommendations via TanStack Query
- **Local State**: UI preferences, filter selections, questionnaire responses
- **Persistent Storage**: Student preferences, completed questionnaires, track history
- **Real-time Updates**: Course progress updates, new course notifications

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Load track content on-demand
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache course recommendations and track metadata
- **Prefetching**: Preload likely next courses in learning path
- **Virtualization**: For large course lists in discovery interface

### User Experience Flow
1. **Onboarding Assessment**: New students complete guided questionnaire
2. **Track Recommendation**: Present 1-3 recommended tracks with reasoning
3. **Track Selection**: Allow manual override with detailed track comparison
4. **Dashboard Integration**: Show filtered courses prominently on dashboard
5. **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators of track completion and milestones
6. **Adaptive Recommendations**: Continuously refine suggestions based on behavior

## Data Models

### Student Track Assignment
- Primary track selection with confidence score
- Secondary tracks for cross-functional learning
- Assignment timestamp and reasoning metadata
- Progress tracking across all assigned tracks

### Course Recommendation Engine
- Recommendation source (algorithm, manual, peer-based)
- Confidence scoring and relevance ranking
- A/B testing framework for recommendation strategies
- Feedback loop for recommendation quality improvement

### Learning Preferences
- Time commitment preferences and actual patterns
- Difficulty preference vs assessed capability
- Content format preferences (video, text, interactive)
- Learning pace and deadline preferences

## Integration Points

### Goals System Integration
- Map tracks to goal categories and outcomes
- Show track progress contribution to overall goals
- Suggest track changes when goals are updated
- Highlight courses that directly advance goal metrics

### Dashboard Enhancement
- Replace generic course grid with personalized recommendations
- Add "Continue Learning" section for in-progress track courses
- Show upcoming milestones and achievements
- Display peer progress and community engagement within track

### Progress Tracking
- Track completion percentage across multiple dimensions
- Skill development progression within track focus areas
- Cross-track skill transfer and recognition
- Certification and milestone achievement tracking

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
- Component testing for all UI interactions
- Integration testing for recommendation algorithms
- User acceptance testing with actual student workflows
- Performance testing for large course catalogs

### Accessibility Requirements
- Keyboard navigation for entire track selection flow
- Screen reader optimization for track descriptions
- High contrast mode for visual track representations
- Mobile-responsive design for all components

### Analytics Integration
- Track selection conversion rates
- Course discovery engagement metrics

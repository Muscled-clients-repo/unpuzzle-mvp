# Bug and Feature Request System - MVP Architecture Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the MVP architecture for expanding the existing requests system to handle bug reports and feature requests using a simple unified list approach while maintaining compliance with the Professional 3-Layer SSOT Distribution pattern from file 001.

## Current System Assessment

### Existing Infrastructure
- Requests table with `request_type` field supporting track changes
- Professional 3-layer architecture: TanStack Query (server state), Form State (input processing), Zustand (UI state)
- Server Actions pattern for all database mutations
- Unified conversation system for goal management
- Flexible metadata schema supporting different request types

### Established Patterns
- Request submission flow with questionnaire integration
- Instructor review and approval workflow
- Status management (pending, approved, rejected)
- Real-time updates via TanStack Query invalidation

## Architectural Principles Alignment

### 3-Layer SSOT Distribution Compliance
**TanStack Query Layer**: Owns all server-related request state including bug reports, feature requests, and their metadata. Handles caching, background refetch, and optimistic updates for request management operations.

**Form State Layer**: Manages input processing for request submission forms including bug report details, reproduction steps, feature descriptions, and priority assessments. Maintains form validation and dirty state tracking.

**Zustand Layer**: Controls UI-specific state including request filtering, modal visibility, submission flow state, and view preferences. No data duplication with server layer.

### Server Actions Integration
All request mutations (create, update, approve, reject) flow through server actions maintaining security boundaries and proper validation. Bug and feature requests follow identical mutation patterns as track changes.

### Conversation System Integration
Bug reports and feature requests integrate with existing conversation architecture for instructor-student communication about issues and feature discussions.

## Request Type Expansion Strategy

### Type-Agnostic Foundation
Leverage existing requests table polymorphic design where `request_type` field determines behavior and `metadata` field stores type-specific information. This approach requires zero schema changes while supporting unlimited request types.

### Metadata Schema Patterns
**Bug Reports**: Include reproduction steps, severity level, affected browser/device, error screenshots, expected vs actual behavior, and technical environment details.

**Feature Requests**: Include use case description, user story format, business justification, proposed solution, alternative solutions considered, and implementation complexity estimates.

### Validation Strategy
Server-side validation enforces metadata schema requirements per request type using conditional validation patterns. Client-side form validation provides immediate feedback using form state layer ownership.

## MVP User Interface Architecture

### Simple Unified List Approach
Extend existing `/instructor/requests` route with a single unified list displaying all request types with visual differentiation through colored badges. No filtering or tabs required for MVP.

### Badge System
- üîÑ Track Assignment (blue badge)
- üêõ Bug Report (red badge)
- ‚ú® Feature Request (green badge)

### Submission Flow Integration
Reuse existing request submission form with simple type selector dropdown. Minimal additional fields per type:
- Bug Reports: Title + Description + Steps to Reproduce
- Feature Requests: Title + Description + Use Case

### Review Workflow Simplification
Different actions per request type using same detail view:
- Track Changes: Accept/Reject + Goal Assignment (existing)
- Bug Reports: Mark as Fixed/Close
- Feature Requests: Mark as Planned/Close

## Data Flow Architecture

### Request Lifecycle Management
**Submission Phase**: Students/instructors submit requests through unified form interface with type-specific validation and metadata collection.

**Review Phase**: Instructors access categorized request lists with type-appropriate review interfaces and action options.

**Resolution Phase**: Different request types follow distinct resolution paths while maintaining unified status tracking and communication channels.

### Cross-Request Analytics
Implement analytics aggregation across request types using separate TanStack Query domains preventing data mixing. Analytics combine request volume, resolution times, and satisfaction metrics without violating layer boundaries.

## Performance Optimization Principles

### Query Efficiency Patterns
Request filtering uses database-level filtering rather than client-side filtering to maintain performance with large request volumes. Separate query keys per request type enable selective cache invalidation.

### Real-Time Update Strategy
Leverage existing WebSocket infrastructure for real-time request status updates. Bug reports and feature requests broadcast status changes to relevant participants without additional infrastructure.

### Cache Management
Request type filtering maintains separate cache entries preventing unnecessary refetch when switching between bug reports and feature requests. Cache invalidation targets specific request types rather than entire request collections.

## Security and Access Control

### Role-Based Request Management
Different request types require different permission levels: students submit all types, instructors review track changes and bugs, admins handle feature requests and system-level issues.

### Data Sensitivity Handling
Bug reports may contain sensitive system information requiring restricted access. Feature requests may contain business strategy information requiring admin-level review.

### Audit Trail Requirements
All request status changes maintain comprehensive audit trails for accountability and process improvement analysis.

## Integration Points

### Existing System Compatibility
Bug and feature request implementation maintains full backward compatibility with track change requests. No changes to existing track assignment workflow or conversation integration.

### Conversation System Extension
Bug reports and feature requests optionally integrate with conversation system for ongoing discussion between requesters and reviewers. Conversation integration follows existing patterns without modification.

### Notification System Integration
Request status changes trigger notifications through existing notification infrastructure. Different request types may have different notification urgency levels and recipient lists.

## MVP Implementation Approach

### Single Phase Development
MVP implementation adds two new request types to existing system:
1. Add `bug_report` and `feature_request` to request types
2. Extend submission form with type selector and minimal additional fields
3. Add colored badges to existing request list
4. Implement simple resolution actions per type

### Risk Mitigation
MVP implementation requires minimal changes to existing codebase. New request types reuse all existing patterns for submission, display, and state management.

### Testing Strategy
Test new request types using existing test patterns. Focus on form submission with different types and proper badge display in request lists.

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
Response time for request submission and review remains consistent across request types. Database query performance maintains current standards regardless of request volume growth.

### User Experience Metrics
Request submission completion rates and instructor processing times demonstrate system effectiveness. User satisfaction with bug reporting and feature request processes indicates successful integration.

### Operational Metrics
Request resolution times and status change frequency provide insights for process optimization. Request type distribution helps resource allocation for different workflow requirements.

## MVP Scope Summary

### What's Included
- Two new request types: Bug Reports and Feature Requests
- Simple type selector in existing submission form
- Colored badge differentiation in unified request list
- Basic resolution actions per request type
- Minimal additional fields for each type

### What's Excluded (Future Enhancements)
- Advanced filtering and tabs
- Priority or severity systems
- Workflow automation
- Advanced analytics
- Integration with external tools

### MVP Success Criteria

# Phase 1: Database Index Implementation Plan - Unpuzzle MVP
*Date: September 23, 2025*

## Executive Summary

This document provides a detailed, incremental implementation plan for Phase 1 database index optimization, designed to achieve 10x performance improvement for critical user journeys. The plan aligns with the 001 architectural guidelines and focuses on zero-downtime, concurrent index creation.

## Current Database State Analysis

### Existing Index Coverage
- **Total Tables**: 45+ core tables in production schema
- **Current Indexes**: 155 existing indexes across all tables
- **Critical Gaps**: High-frequency query patterns without proper indexing
- **Performance Impact**: 500ms-1000ms per unoptimized query

### High-Frequency Query Pattern Analysis

#### 1. Student Progress Tracking (Critical Path)
**Current Bottlenecks**:
- `video_progress` table: 15+ queries per student dashboard load
- `enrollments` table: Complex progress calculations on every page
- No composite indexes for multi-column filters

#### 2. Course Discovery System (High Impact)
**Current Bottlenecks**:
- Goal-based course filtering: Multiple JOIN operations
- Track assignment queries: Sequential table scans
- Course metadata filtering: Missing composite indexes

#### 3. Conversation Timeline (Frequent Access)
**Current Bottlenecks**:
- Message retrieval with attachment joins
- Chronological ordering without proper indexes
- User-specific conversation filtering

#### 4. AI Interaction Patterns (Growing Usage)
**Current Bottlenecks**:
- Student-course-specific AI history
- Timestamp-based interaction queries
- Cross-course AI context retrieval

## Phase 1 Implementation Strategy

### Principle Alignment with 001 Guidelines

#### TanStack Query Integration
- **Server State Ownership**: Indexes support TanStack Query cache optimization

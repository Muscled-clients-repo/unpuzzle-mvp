## Core Principle

### Client-Server Security Boundary
Professional video platforms maintain strict security boundaries where clients work exclusively with entity IDs while servers handle all storage operations, credentials, and file system details. This ensures security, maintainability, and clean architectural separation.

### Architecture-Compliant Implementation  
Modern video management must respect established layer boundaries: TanStack Query handles server data and mutations, Zustand manages UI feedback states, Server Actions replace API routes, and components orchestrate the coordination.

### Professional User Experience Standards
Video operations should feel immediate and professional. Upload progress displays immediately, deletions appear instant through optimistic updates, and errors are handled gracefully without compromising security or architectural integrity.

---

## Architecture Integration

### TanStack Query Layer Responsibility
TanStack Query owns all video-related server data and mutations. Upload mutations handle file transfers with progress tracking, deletion mutations provide optimistic updates with rollback, and video data queries maintain cache consistency.

### Server Actions Security Boundary
Server Actions replace API routes for all video operations. They handle file uploads, storage coordination, database operations, and cleanup while maintaining complete separation from client-side code.

### Zustand UI Layer Responsibility
Zustand manages immediate visual feedback for video operations: upload progress indicators, loading states during operations, temporary UI states, and operation success/failure visual feedback.

### Component Layer Orchestration  
Components coordinate video operations across layers without owning storage logic. They trigger TanStack mutations, display Zustand UI states, handle user interactions, and provide error feedback.

---

## Security Architecture

### Client Knowledge Boundaries
Clients never access storage implementation details: no storage paths, provider credentials, bucket configurations, CDN construction logic, or file system structures. Clients work exclusively with video IDs and display URLs.

### Server Storage Ownership
Servers own complete storage lifecycle: path generation strategies, storage provider interactions, credential management, file cleanup operations, and CDN URL management. All storage complexity remains server-side.

### Data Flow Security
Upload operations send files with minimal metadata to server actions. Servers generate secure storage paths, handle provider uploads, manage database records, and return only necessary client data (URLs and IDs).

---

## Implementation Patterns

### Video Upload Flow (Modern Architecture)

#### Layer Responsibilities
```
TanStack Query Mutation:
  - Handle file upload with progress tracking
  - Call server action with file and metadata
  - Update video data cache on success
  - Provide automatic rollback on failure

Server Action:
  - Generate secure storage paths
  - Upload file to storage provider
  - Create database records
  - Return minimal client data (URL, ID)

Zustand UI State:
  - Track upload progress indicators
  - Manage loading states
  - Handle operation visual feedback

Component Orchestration:
  - Trigger upload mutation
  - Display progress from Zustand
  - Handle success/failure feedback
```

#### File Organization
```
mutations/
  video-upload-mutation.ts       // TanStack upload mutation
actions/
  upload-video-action.ts         // Server action for storage
stores/
  video-ui-store.ts             // Upload progress and UI states
components/
  video-uploader.tsx            // Orchestrates upload flow
services/
  storage-service.ts            // Server-side storage abstraction
```

### Video Deletion Flow (Architecture-Compliant)

#### Security-First Deletion Process
Server actions receive only video IDs from clients. Servers query database for storage details, coordinate storage provider deletion, clean up database records, and confirm completion to client without exposing implementation details.

#### Optimistic Update Coordination
TanStack Query provides optimistic deletion in video cache, Zustand shows immediate loading indicators, components coordinate both updates, and automatic rollback occurs on server failures.

## Storage Security Patterns

### Credential Isolation
All storage credentials remain server-side: API keys in server environment, access tokens in secure storage, provider configurations in server code, and zero credential exposure to client applications.

### Path Generation Strategy
Servers generate consistent, secure storage paths: course-based directory structures, chapter-based organization, unique video identifiers, and collision-resistant naming schemes.

### Provider Abstraction
Storage operations abstract provider details: standardized interfaces for different providers, configurable storage backends, consistent upload/delete operations, and easy provider migration capabilities.

---

## Professional User Experience

### Upload Experience Standards
Video uploads provide professional feedback: immediate upload queue display, real-time progress indicators, individual video status tracking, and clear success/failure messaging.

### Deletion Experience Standards
Video deletions feel instant through optimistic updates: immediate removal from UI, clear loading indicators, graceful error handling, and automatic state recovery on failures.

### Error Handling Integration
Video operations integrate with Error Boundary patterns: upload failures show user-friendly recovery options, deletion errors provide retry mechanisms, and network issues display appropriate messaging.

---

## Performance Optimization

### Upload Performance Strategy
Video uploads optimize for user experience: chunked upload for large files, concurrent upload capabilities, background processing, and efficient progress reporting.

### Cache Management
Video data integrates with TanStack Query caching: intelligent cache invalidation after operations, optimistic updates for immediate feedback, background refresh for data consistency, and efficient memory usage.

### Network Efficiency
Operations minimize network usage: upload progress streaming, efficient retry strategies, compressed metadata transfer, and intelligent request batching.

---

## Integration with Existing Patterns

### Optimistic Updates Integration
Video operations leverage optimistic update patterns: TanStack Query handles data optimism, Zustand manages UI optimism, components coordinate both types, and error recovery maintains consistency.

### Bulk Operations Support
Video management supports bulk operations: multiple video selection, concurrent upload processing, batch deletion capabilities, and coordinated progress reporting.

### Concurrent Loading Pattern
Video operations integrate with concurrent patterns: parallel upload processing, simultaneous deletion operations, coordinated progress tracking, and efficient resource utilization.

## Data Flow Architecture

### Upload Data Flow
```
Component → TanStack Mutation → Server Action → Storage Provider
    ↓           ↓                    ↓              ↓
Zustand UI ← Progress Updates ← Database Record ← Upload Success
```

### Deletion Data Flow  
```
Component → TanStack Mutation → Server Action → Database Query
    ↓           ↓                    ↓              ↓
Zustand UI ← Optimistic Update ← Storage Delete ← Cleanup Complete
```

### Error Recovery Flow
```
Storage Failure → Server Action Error → TanStack Rollback → UI Recovery
                                    ↓                    ↓
                             Error Boundary ← Component Notification
```

## Security Compliance

### Client-Side Security
Clients maintain security boundaries: no storage credentials, no provider-specific logic, no file system knowledge, and minimal metadata exposure.

### Server-Side Security  
Servers handle all sensitive operations: credential management, storage provider authentication, secure path generation, and complete operation logging.

### Audit Trail Requirements
Video operations maintain audit trails: operation logging, user action tracking, storage operation records, and security event monitoring.

---

## Migration Strategy

### Legacy Pattern Migration
Existing client-side storage operations require systematic migration: identify direct storage calls, create server action replacements, update client code for ID-only operations, and remove client storage dependencies.

### Architecture Alignment
Migration must maintain architectural compliance: move storage logic to server actions, update clients to use TanStack mutations, implement Zustand UI states, and ensure component orchestration patterns.

### Testing Strategy
Migration requires comprehensive testing: upload/delete cycle validation, error handling verification, security boundary testing, and performance benchmarking.

---

## Scalability Considerations

### Storage Provider Flexibility
Architecture supports multiple storage providers: abstracted storage interfaces, configurable provider selection, migration capabilities between providers, and consistent operation semantics.

### Performance Scaling
Video operations scale efficiently: concurrent operation support, resource usage optimization, intelligent batching strategies, and performance monitoring integration.

### Security Scaling
Security patterns scale with application growth: centralized credential management, audit trail scaling, access control integration, and security monitoring capabilities.

---

## Testing Patterns

### Security Testing
Verify security boundaries: client cannot access storage credentials, servers handle all storage operations, error messages don't leak implementation details, and audit trails capture all operations.

### Integration Testing  
Test architectural compliance: TanStack mutations handle server operations, Zustand manages UI states only, Server Actions replace API routes, and component coordination works correctly.

### Performance Testing
Validate performance characteristics: upload progress accuracy, deletion speed optimization, concurrent operation handling, and resource usage efficiency.

---

## Success Metrics

### Security Indicators
Measure security compliance: zero credential exposure incidents, complete audit trail coverage, successful security boundary maintenance, and clean separation of concerns.

### User Experience Metrics
Track user satisfaction: upload success rates, deletion operation speed, progress reporting accuracy, and error recovery effectiveness.

### Technical Quality Measures
Monitor technical implementation: architectural compliance maintenance, performance optimization results, error handling effectiveness, and scalability preparation.

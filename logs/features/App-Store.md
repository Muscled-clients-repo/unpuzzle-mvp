2. **Community-Driven Innovation** - Developers build what instructors need
3. **Subject-Specific Specialization** - Apps tailored for different learning domains
4. **Revenue Sharing Ecosystem** - Sustainable business model for all parties
5. **Seamless Integration** - Apps feel native to the platform
6. **Security & Sandboxing** - Third-party code runs safely
7. **Data Portability** - Instructors own their content and student data

## 🔌 Technical Architecture Concepts

### Plugin System Foundation
All functionality delivered through a unified plugin architecture where apps can:
- **Hook into video player events** (play, pause, seek, segment selection)
- **Render custom UI elements** (sidebars, overlays, controls)
- **Access platform APIs** (student data, course content, progress tracking)
- **Communicate with external services** (APIs, databases, cloud functions)
- **Store app-specific data** (settings, user preferences, learning analytics)

### App Capability Framework
Apps declare their capabilities and required permissions:
- **Video Integration** - Overlay content, respond to playback events
- **Course Content Access** - Read/write course materials and structure
- **Student Data Access** - Progress tracking, analytics, personalization
- **External API Access** - Third-party service integrations
- **File Storage** - Upload/download course-related files
- **Real-time Communication** - Live collaboration features

### Security & Sandboxing Model
- **Capability-based permissions** - Apps only access declared features
- **Data isolation** - App data separated from core platform data
- **API rate limiting** - Prevent abuse of platform resources
- **Code review process** - Manual approval for marketplace apps
- **Runtime monitoring** - Track app performance and behavior
- **Emergency shutdown** - Ability to disable problematic apps instantly

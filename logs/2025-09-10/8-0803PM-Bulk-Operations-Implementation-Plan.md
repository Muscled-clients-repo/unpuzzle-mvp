# Bulk Media Operations Implementation Plan
## Architecture-Compliant Implementation Based on Enhanced Principles

## Executive Summary

This implementation plan details how to build the bulk media operations feature following the enhanced architecture principles. The plan addresses the drag selection failures identified in the RCA and implements a complete solution that maintains 3-layer SSOT compliance while delivering professional-grade user interactions.

**Goal**: Enable users to select multiple media files via drag selection and perform bulk operations (delete, move, tag) with real-time progress tracking.

**Architecture Foundation**: 3-Layer SSOT with Advanced User Interaction Patterns for complex DOM coordination.

## Implementation Strategy Overview

### Phase 1: Architecture-Compliant Drag Selection (Current Priority)
- Fix existing drag selection implementation using enhanced architecture principles
- Implement robust event coordination and visual feedback
- Establish foundation for bulk operations

### Phase 2: Bulk Delete with WebSocket Progress (Next Phase)
- Build on Phase 1 selection foundation
- Implement WebSocket progress tracking using existing patterns
- Add bulk operation confirmation and error handling

### Phase 3: Extended Bulk Operations (Future)
- Add bulk move, tag, and organize operations
- Implement bulk edit forms with selection-driven state
- Add keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features

## Phase 1: Architecture-Compliant Drag Selection Implementation

### 1.1 Event Architecture Redesign

#### Problem Resolution Strategy
**Current Issue**: Event handlers conflict and prevent drag detection
**Solution**: Implement Event Delegation Hierarchy pattern from enhanced architecture

#### Event Flow Redesign
1. **Container-Level Event Capture**: Move event listener to container with capture phase
2. **Event Phase Management**: Use proper event timing to distinguish clicks from drags
3. **Coordinate System Normalization**: Standardize all coordinates to container-relative
4. **Conflict Prevention**: Remove competing click handlers during drag operations

#### Implementation Approach
- Remove current event listeners from individual media items
- Implement single container-level event delegation system
- Use capture phase to intercept events before bubbling to children
- Establish clear event priority: drag detection → individual selection → other interactions

### 1.2 State Management Redesign

#### Temporal State Separation Implementation
**Principle**: Separate temporary drag state from permanent selection state

#### Zustand State Structure Enhancement
```
dragSelection: {
  isActive: boolean              // Current drag status
  startPoint: Point | null       // Container-relative start coordinates  
  currentPoint: Point | null     // Container-relative current coordinates
  selectedDuringDrag: Set<string> // Temporary selections during drag
  phase: 'inactive' | 'starting' | 'active' | 'completing' // State phase
}

selection: {
  selectedFiles: Set<string>     // Permanent selections
  lastSelectedId: string | null  // For range selection anchor
  selectionMode: 'replace' | 'add' | 'subtract' // Based on modifier keys
}
```

#### State Transition Management
1. **Inactive → Starting**: Mouse down with movement threshold check
2. **Starting → Active**: Movement exceeds threshold (5px), enable visual feedback
3. **Active → Completing**: Mouse up with drag completion logic
4. **Completing → Inactive**: State cleanup and permanent selection merge

### 1.3 Visual Feedback System

#### Immediate Response Implementation
**Principle**: Sub-100ms visual feedback for all interactions

#### Visual Components
1. **Drag Rectangle**: Blue border rectangle following mouse movement
2. **Selection Highlights**: Blue ring around selected/preview items
3. **Selection Counter**: Live count during drag operation
4. **Auto-scroll Indicators**: Visual feedback during edge scrolling

#### Rendering Strategy
- Drag rectangle renders immediately on first mouse move (not after state update)
- Selection highlights update during drag using `selectedDuringDrag` set
- Use CSS transforms for smooth 60fps rectangle movement
- Separate animation state from business logic state for performance

### 1.4 Coordinate System Standardization

#### Container-Relative Coordinate System
**Problem**: Screen coordinates cause intersection calculation errors
**Solution**: Normalize all coordinates to container-relative system

#### Coordinate Transformation Pipeline
1. **Event Capture**: Receive screen coordinates from mouse events
2. **Container Normalization**: Convert to container-relative coordinates
3. **Scroll Offset Handling**: Account for container scroll position
4. **Intersection Calculation**: Use normalized coordinates for element detection

#### Implementation Details
- Create coordinate transformation utility functions
- Handle scroll offset changes during drag operations
- Account for container padding and borders in calculations
- Ensure consistent coordinate handling across all interaction phases

### 1.5 Intersection Detection Optimization

#### Performance-Optimized Element Detection
**Principle**: DOM Query Optimization from enhanced architecture

#### Optimization Strategy
1. **Cache DOM Queries**: Pre-calculate element positions when drag starts
2. **Efficient Intersection Algorithm**: Use spatial partitioning for large lists
3. **Throttled Updates**: Throttle intersection detection to maintain 60fps
4. **Early Exit Conditions**: Skip calculations when drag rectangle is empty

#### Implementation Approach
- Cache `getBoundingClientRect()` results at drag start
- Update cache only when container scrolls or resizes
- Use Set operations for O(1) selection state updates
- Implement spatial indexing for media items in large lists

## Phase 2: Bulk Delete with WebSocket Progress

### 2.1 Selection Integration with Bulk Operations

#### Architecture-Compliant Integration
**Principle**: Selection state from Zustand feeds TanStack mutations calling server actions

#### Integration Flow
1. **Selection State**: Read from Zustand `selectedFiles` Set
2. **Bulk Operation Trigger**: TanStack mutation receives selection array
3. **Server Action Call**: Mutation calls bulk delete server action
4. **Progress Tracking**: WebSocket progress updates via existing pattern

#### State Coordination
- Selection state remains in Zustand (UI layer)
- Operation progress tracked in TanStack Query (server state layer)
- Visual feedback coordinates between both layers without data mixing

### 2.2 WebSocket Progress Implementation

#### Reuse Existing WebSocket Architecture
**Foundation**: Use established WebSocket pattern from video upload system

#### Progress Flow Implementation
1. **Server Action Initiation**: Bulk delete server action starts operation
2. **HTTP Bridge Communication**: Server action posts progress to WebSocket server
3. **WebSocket Broadcasting**: Progress updates broadcast to connected clients
4. **Observer Pattern Integration**: WebSocket messages → Observer events → TanStack cache
5. **Component Updates**: Components read progress from TanStack hooks

#### Progress State Structure
```
bulkOperations: {
  [operationId]: {
    id: string
    type: 'delete' | 'move' | 'tag'
    totalItems: number
    completedItems: number
    failedItems: string[]
    status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'complete' | 'error'
    progress: number // 0-100
  }
}
```

### 2.3 Bulk Operation UI Components

#### BulkSelectionToolbar Enhancement
**Current**: Basic toolbar with selection count
**Enhanced**: Add progress tracking and operation status

#### Component Features
1. **Selection Summary**: Count, select all, clear selection
2. **Operation Buttons**: Delete, move, tag with confirmation
3. **Progress Display**: Real-time progress bar during operations
4. **Error Handling**: Display and retry failed operations

#### Progress Display Component
- **FloatingProgressPanel**: Reuse existing pattern from upload system
- **Operation Status**: Show current operation and progress percentage  
- **Item-Level Status**: Individual file operation status
- **Error Recovery**: Retry failed items, skip errors

### 2.4 Confirmation and Error Handling

#### Bulk Operation Confirmation Pattern
**Architecture**: Form state for confirmation, Zustand for modal state

#### Confirmation Flow
1. **Selection Review**: Show selected items and operation details
2. **Impact Preview**: Estimate operation scope and warnings
3. **User Confirmation**: Modal with operation confirmation
4. **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time progress during operation

#### Error Handling Strategy
- **Partial Success**: Complete successful operations, report failures
- **Recovery Options**: Retry failed items, skip errors, cancel operation
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages with suggested actions
- **State Cleanup**: Proper cleanup on operation completion or cancellation

## Phase 3: Extended Bulk Operations (Future Implementation)

### 3.1 Bulk Move Operations

#### Cross-Course Media Movement
**Architecture**: Server actions handle course relationship updates

#### Implementation Features
- **Destination Selection**: Course/chapter picker for move target
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle duplicate file names and overwrites
- **Permission Validation**: Ensure user can access destination courses
- **Relationship Updates**: Update course-media relationships in database

### 3.2 Bulk Tagging System

#### Tag Management Integration
**Architecture**: Tag state in TanStack Query, UI state in Zustand

#### Tagging Features
- **Bulk Tag Addition**: Add tags to multiple selected files
- **Bulk Tag Removal**: Remove tags from selected files
- **Tag Suggestions**: Auto-complete based on existing tags
- **Tag Preview**: Show tag changes before applying

### 3.3 Keyboard Shortcuts and Accessibility

#### Professional Keyboard Navigation
**Standards**: Follow platform conventions for bulk operations

#### Keyboard Features
- **Ctrl+A**: Select all visible files
- **Ctrl+Click**: Toggle individual selection
- **Shift+Click**: Range selection from last selected
- **Delete Key**: Initiate bulk delete for selected items
- **Escape**: Cancel active operations

#### Accessibility Implementation

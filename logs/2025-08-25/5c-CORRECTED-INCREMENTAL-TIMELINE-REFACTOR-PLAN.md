# Corrected Incremental TimelineClips Refactor Plan - Architecture V2 Aligned
**Date:** 2025-08-25  
**Goal:** Transform 683-line monolith following Architecture V2 principles  
**Strategy:** Small increments with manual verification, aligned with consolidated approach

## Alignment with Architecture V2

### Key Principles Followed:
- **Consolidated Timeline Approach** - avoid deep component hierarchies (max 2 levels)
- **Extract complex logic into utility functions** - not separate operation components
- **Frame/time utilities** go in `/src/lib/video-editor/utils.ts`
- **Break down large functions** into smaller, focused ones within same file initially
- **Clear separation between state and presentation** within single component

## Lessons Learned from Failed Refactor

- Complete component splitting broke clip creation at scrubber position
- Trim shortcuts and cutting areas stopped working
- Complex drag logic was incorrectly reimplemented
- Too many changes at once made debugging impossible

## New Corrected Incremental Strategy

### Phase 1: Extract Pure Utility Functions (30 min)
**Goal:** Move calculations to proper location per Architecture V2  
**Risk:** VERY LOW - pure functions with no side effects

#### Increment 1.1: Frame/Pixel Calculations (10 min)
**What:** Extract basic math functions to `/src/lib/video-editor/utils.ts`
- `frameToPixel(frame: number, pixelsPerFrame: number): number`
- `pixelToFrame(pixel: number, pixelsPerFrame: number): number`
- `getClipLeftPosition(clip: VideoClip, pixelsPerFrame: number): number`
- `getClipWidth(clip: VideoClip, pixelsPerFrame: number): number`

**Files to modify:**
- Add functions to existing `/src/lib/video-editor/utils.ts`
- Import and use in `TimelineClips.tsx` (replace inline calculations)

**Manual check required:**
- [ ] All clips still render in correct positions
- [ ] Drag still works exactly the same
- [ ] Trim still works exactly the same
- [ ] Clip creation at scrubber position unchanged

**⚠️ USER CONFIRMATION REQUIRED:** Wait for user confirmation before proceeding to next increment

#### Increment 1.2: Magnetic Snap Logic (10 min)
**What:** Extract snapping calculations to utils
- `getSnappedPosition(position: number, snapTargets: number[], tolerance: number): number`
- `getSnapTargets(clips: VideoClip[], tracks: Track[], currentFrame: number): number[]`

**Files to modify:**
- Add functions to `/src/lib/video-editor/utils.ts`
- Import and use in `TimelineClips.tsx`

**Manual check required:**
- [ ] Magnetic snapping still works during drag
- [ ] Clips snap to scrubber position
- [ ] Clips snap to other clip edges
- [ ] Clips snap to whole seconds

**⚠️ USER CONFIRMATION REQUIRED:** Wait for user confirmation before proceeding to next increment

#### Increment 1.3: Track Helper Functions (10 min)
**What:** Extract track-related calculations
- `findTrackFromElement(element: HTMLElement): number | null`
- `getNextTrackIndex(tracks: Track[]): number`
- `calculateTrackHeight(trackIndex: number): number`

**Files to modify:**
- Add functions to `/src/lib/video-editor/utils.ts`
- Import and use in `TimelineClips.tsx`

**Manual check required:**
- [ ] Track selection still works
- [ ] Drag between tracks still works
- [ ] New track creation preview still works

**⚠️ USER CONFIRMATION REQUIRED:** Wait for user confirmation before proceeding to next increment

**STOP POINT:** Only proceed if ALL functionality works perfectly

## Safety Measures

### Before Each Increment:
1. **Git commit** current state with clear message
2. **Test core functionality** manually 
3. **Note specific areas to test** after change

### After Each Increment:
1. **Manual testing checklist** (provided above)
2. **Performance check** - no slowdowns
3. **Visual inspection** - everything looks the same
4. **If ANY issue found:** Immediate git revert

### Testing Protocol for Each Increment:
1. Record video ✅ - clip creation at scrubber position
2. Drag clips ✅ - position, tracks, new track creation  
3. Trim clips ✅ - start, end, keyboard shortcuts
4. Select clips/tracks ✅ - visual feedback
5. Preview tracks ✅ - positioning during drag

### Rollback Strategy:
- Any failed increment = immediate `git revert HEAD`
- Return to previous working state
- Analyze what went wrong
- Adjust approach for that specific increment

## Key Differences from Previous Plan (5a/5b)

### ✅ Architecture V2 Aligned:
- Utilities go to `/src/lib/video-editor/utils.ts` (not timeline folder)
- Function extraction within same file first (not component splitting)
- Consolidated approach - avoid deep hierarchies
- Component splitting only if absolutely necessary

### ✅ Safer Approach:
- Smaller increments
- Keep logic in same file initially
- Component extraction only as last resort
- More conservative about file separation

### ✅ Preserved Functionality:
- Focus on organization, not architecture changes
- Maintain all existing behavior patterns
- Gradual improvement without breaking changes

## Expected Timeline:
- **Phase 1:** 30 minutes (utility extraction)
- **Phase 2:** 1 hour (function organization)  
- **Phase 3:** 45 minutes (rendering separation)
- **Phase 4:** 45 minutes (conditional component split)
- **Phase 5:** 30 minutes (polish and optimization)

**Total: ~3 hours with careful testing**

## Success Criteria:
- [ ] All original functionality preserved
- [ ] Code is more organized within Architecture V2 constraints
- [ ] Utilities properly located in `/src/lib/video-editor/utils.ts`
- [ ] Functions are smaller and focused
- [ ] Foundation set for future safe improvements

## Next Steps After Phase 5:
If all phases succeed, the codebase will be:
- Better organized within consolidated approach
- Easier to understand and modify
- Ready for additional features
- Compliant with Architecture V2 principles

This approach ensures we never break working functionality while gradually improving code organization within the established architecture constraints.

# BULLETPROOF V3.0 Architecture Principles

*Core principles and proven patterns for professional video editor architecture*

## üéØ Core Architecture Principles

### Principle 0: Frame-Based Single Source of Truth
- **RULE**: ALL time calculations use frame numbers as the primary source of truth
- **PRECISION**: State Machine stores frame numbers (integers), time values calculated only when needed
- **PROFESSIONAL STANDARD**: Follows industry practice (Adobe Premiere, DaVinci Resolve, Final Cut Pro)
- **SYNC GUARANTEE**: Frame-based calculations eliminate floating-point precision issues
- **CONVERSION**: Frame numbers convert to time/pixels only for display and external services

### Principle 1: Single Source of Truth (SSOT)
- **RULE**: Every piece of queryable state exists in exactly ONE place - the State Machine
- **AUTHORITY**: State Machine stores BOTH business state AND technical state
- **FRAME ENHANCEMENT**: Primary state stored as frame numbers with frame rate metadata
- **ENFORCEMENT**: TypeScript interfaces prevent duplicate state storage
- **REQUIREMENT**: Integration Layer pattern bridges State Machine decisions to services

### Principle 2: State Machine Authority
- **RULE**: All state changes go through validated state machine transitions
- **BUSINESS LOGIC**: State Machine contains ALL business logic, not just state storage
- **PRE-CALCULATION**: State Machine pre-calculates decisions for Integration Layer
- **GUARDS**: Complex conditional state transitions for real-world flows
- **VALIDATION**: Every state change must be validated before execution

### Principle 3: Service Boundary Isolation
- **RULE**: Each service has single responsibility with clear boundaries
- **EXECUTOR ROLE**: Services are stateless executors that only manipulate external resources
- **NO BUSINESS LOGIC**: Services cannot make business decisions or store business state
- **INTEGRATION**: Services respond to Integration Layer, not direct method calls
- **EXTERNAL ONLY**: Services only interact with external resources (DOM, APIs, etc.)

### Principle 4: Integration Layer Coordination
- **RULE**: Integration Layer observes State Machine and coordinates service execution
- **OBSERVER**: Subscribes to State Machine changes, forwards decisions to services
- **NO LOGIC**: Integration Layer only forwards pre-calculated decisions
- **BIDIRECTIONAL**: Handles State Machine ‚Üí Services and Services ‚Üí State Machine flow
- **CLEANUP**: Responsible for action cleanup after execution

### Principle 5: Pure Component Pattern
- **RULE**: React components only render, never manage state
- **QUERIES**: Components read state via Query Layer
- **COMMANDS**: Components trigger actions via Command Layer
- **NO HOOKS**: No useState for business logic in components
- **RENDER ONLY**: Components are pure rendering functions

### Principle 6: Query Layer SSOT Compliance
- **RULE**: Query Layer reads from State Machine ONLY
- **NO SERVICE ACCESS**: Queries never read from services directly
- **READ-ONLY**: Queries are pure read operations with no side effects
- **FRAME CONVERSION**: Queries handle frame-to-time conversion for components
- **SINGLE PATH**: All state queries follow one path: Component ‚Üí Query ‚Üí State Machine

### Principle 7: Command Layer Unidirectional Flow
- **RULE**: Commands only send events to State Machine, never call services directly
- **EVENT-ONLY**: Commands translate user actions into State Machine events
- **NO LOGIC**: Commands contain no business logic, only event dispatching
- **VALIDATION**: Commands may validate input format but not business rules
- **SINGLE DIRECTION**: All commands follow one path: Component ‚Üí Command ‚Üí State Machine

## üîß Proven Working Patterns

### Pattern 1: Pending Action Pattern
**Purpose**: State Machine pre-calculates complex decisions
- State Machine sets pending actions in context
- Integration Layer reads pending actions
- Services execute pre-calculated decisions
- State Machine clears pending actions after execution
- Prevents business logic in Integration Layer

### Pattern 2: Observer Subscription Pattern
**Purpose**: Loose coupling between State Machine and services
- Integration Layer subscribes to State Machine
- Tracks previous state to detect changes
- Compares current vs processed actions
- Forwards only new actions to services
- Maintains single subscription point

### Pattern 3: Race Condition Prevention Pattern
**Purpose**: Prevent overlapping operations
- Atomic operation locks (isProcessingClipTransition, isProcessingSeek)
- Check lock before starting operation
- Set lock when operation begins
- Clear lock in finally block
- Timeout recovery for stuck locks

### Pattern 4: Video Reuse Optimization Pattern
**Purpose**: Optimize video element usage for performance
- Check if same video already loaded
- Compare base clip IDs for trimmed segments
- Verify source URLs match
- Skip load if video can be reused
- Seek within existing video instead of reload

### Pattern 5: Action Cleanup Pattern
**Purpose**: Maintain clean state after operations
- Execute service operations
- Send ACTIONS_PROCESSED event
- Clear pending actions from context
- Reset processing flags
- Prevent duplicate processing

### Pattern 6: Frame-to-Time Conversion Pattern
**Purpose**: Bridge frame-based state with time-based services
- Store frames as primary source
- Convert to time only when needed
- Use consistent frame rate
- Round frames for precision
- Cache conversions when possible

## üö´ Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Anti-Pattern 1: Dual Sources of Truth
- ‚ùå Reading time from both State Machine and Services
- ‚ùå Storing same data in multiple locations
- ‚ùå Services exposing queryable state

### Anti-Pattern 2: Business Logic in Services
- ‚ùå Services making decisions
- ‚ùå Services calculating next states
- ‚ùå Services determining clip sequences

### Anti-Pattern 3: Direct Service Communication
- ‚ùå Services calling each other directly
- ‚ùå Components calling services directly
- ‚ùå Bypassing State Machine for state changes

### Anti-Pattern 4: Floating-Point Time Primary Storage
- ‚ùå Storing time as primary source
- ‚ùå Using decimals for frame positions
- ‚ùå Accumulating floating-point errors

### Anti-Pattern 5: Synchronous State Assumptions
- ‚ùå Assuming immediate state updates
- ‚ùå Not handling pending states
- ‚ùå Ignoring race conditions

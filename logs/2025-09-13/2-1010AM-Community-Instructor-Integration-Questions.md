## Status: Strategic Questions for Community-Instructor Feature Alignment

## Executive Summary

Critical questions regarding the integration between community playground features and instructor route functionality. The instructor's role in dictating community goals, course assignments, and member progression requires careful consideration for seamless user experience and data consistency.

## Goal Management Integration Questions

### Goal Setting Authority
**Q1: Goal Creation Workflow**
- 1.1: Who creates the initial goal options that members can select from? (Instructor only vs Member choice vs Hybrid)
- 1.2: Can members create custom goals or only select from instructor-defined templates?
- 1.3: How do instructor-defined goals relate to course progression requirements?

Answer: Instructor creates goal options, when students submit proof of goal achieved (bank statements, screenshots of transactions, etc.), instructor will approve the goal and student will automatically move to the next goal. So at $3k agency goal if they all of a sudden close a $10k client they'll skip other goals and move straight to 10k goal, promoted by instructor.

Members cant create goals.

Instructors can tag courses with goals to know what courses are part of what goals.

**Q2: Goal Progression and Upgrades**
- 2.1: Can instructors recommend goal upgrades when members exceed expectations? (e.g., member targeting $3K achieves it early, instructor suggests upgrading to $5K goal)
- 2.2: Should there be automatic goal progression triggers based on achievement milestones?
- 2.3: What happens to community leaderboard rankings and historical data when members upgrade their goals?
- 2.4: Should goal upgrades trigger notifications to other community members or remain private?

Answer: 2.1, 2.2: Answered above in Q1 - instructor approves proof, students auto-advance/skip goals based on achievements. 2.3: Members achieve their goal in a certain number of days and that's recorded in leaderboard. 2.4: Private.

**Q3: Goal-Course Relationship**
- 3.1: Are community goals directly tied to specific instructor course sequences?
- 3.2: Can members pursue goals that don't align with available courses?
- 3.3: How do we handle goal completion when required courses aren't available yet?

Answer: Goals are chosen by students and approved by instructor. Based on approved goals, students are given access to specific courses that are tagged by those goals. Goals are only approved by instructors.

## Community Content Management

### Instructor Content Control
**Q4: Post Moderation Authority**
- 4.1: Does the instructor have moderation powers over all community posts?
- 4.2: Can instructors pin their own posts automatically vs requiring manual pinning?
- 4.3: Should instructor posts have different visual treatment than member posts?

Answer: 4.1: Yes. 4.2: Manual pinning - instructor clicks "..." then "pin" (like Discord).

4.3 - 
 You Currently Have in Playground:

  Looking at your community posts feed,
  instructor posts already have:
  - Crown icon + "Instructor" badge next to the
  name
  - Blue gradient badge with purple accent
  - Different styling when pinned (yellow pin
  icon) 

  keep it like this
**Q5: Community-Course Content Synchronization**
- 5.1: When instructors create new courses, should they automatically appear in community courses section?
- 5.2: How do instructor course updates reflect in community goal tracking?
- 5.3: Should community members see instructor course drafts or only published courses?

Answer: 5.1: Yes - when instructors create new courses and tag them with goals, they should appear in community courses section for members with those approved goals. 5.2: When instructor updates courses, it affects community members with those goal-tagged courses. 5.3: Only published courses (since members get access based on approved goals).

**Q6: Success Proof Validation**
- 6.1: Does instructor need to approve member success stories before they appear publicly?
- 6.2: Can instructors add their own commentary to member achievements?
- 6.3: How do we prevent false success claims without instructor bottlenecks?

Answer: 6.1: Yes - instructor needs to approve member success stories (based on Q1 - instructor approves goal achievement proof). 6.3: Instructor approval prevents false success claims (instructor validates bank statements/screenshots).

## Leaderboard and Progress Tracking

### Data Source Integration
**Q7: Progress Data Synchronization**
- 7.1: Does community leaderboard pull from instructor course completion data?
- 7.2: How do we handle members who take courses outside the platform but still want community ranking?
- 7.3: Should instructor-assigned quizzes/reflections automatically update community metrics?

**Q8: Learn Rate Calculation**
- 8.1: Is community "Learn Rate" based on instructor course video consumption only?
- 8.2: How do we track video consumption across instructor's multiple courses?
- 8.3: Should community discussions and resource consumption count toward learn rate?

**Q9: Execution Rate Dependency**
- 9.1: Are community execution rates tied to instructor-assigned tasks only?
- 9.2: Can members self-report execution without instructor validation?
- 9.3: How do we prevent gaming the system while maintaining community motivation?

## Resource and Course Management

### Content Ownership Boundaries
**Q10: Resource Library Control**
- 10.1: Can instructors upload directly to community resource library?
- 10.2: Should instructor resources be automatically marked as "premium" vs community resources as "free"?

**Q11: Course-Community Visibility**
- 11.1: Should all instructor courses appear in community courses section regardless of member access?
- 11.2: How do we handle course prerequisites in community course recommendations?
- 11.3: Can instructors create community-specific courses that don't appear in main instructor dashboard?

Answer: 11.1: No - only courses tagged with member's approved goals should appear. 11.2: Prerequisites handled through goal approval process. 11.3: Courses are tagged with goals, so they serve both instructor dashboard and community.

**Q12: Affiliate Integration**
- 12.1: Do instructor earnings factor into community affiliate calculations?

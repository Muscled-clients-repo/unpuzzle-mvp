# Backend Development Overview - Unpuzzle MVP
*Date: August 30, 2025*

## Executive Summary
The Unpuzzle MVP has a sophisticated frontend with mock data but lacks backend implementation. Before starting backend development, specific frontend tasks must be completed to ensure smooth integration.

## Current State Analysis

###  What's Already Built (Frontend)

#### 1. **Authentication UI**
- Login/signup pages with social auth buttons
- User role system (Student, Instructor, Admin, Moderator)
- Profile management interfaces
- Subscription tiers UI (Free, Plus, Pro)
- **Status**: UI complete, needs Supabase client integration

#### 2. **Course Management System**
- Course creation wizard with multi-step form
- Video upload interface (UI only, no actual upload)
- Chapter organization with drag-and-drop
- Course analytics dashboards
- Student enrollment tracking
- **Status**: Full UI complete, uses mock data

#### 3. **Video Player & AI Agents**
- Advanced video player with timeline controls
- 4 AI agents (Hint, Quiz, Reflect, Path) with XState
- Video segment selection for context
- Transcript integration with timestamps
- Voice memo recording for reflections
- **Status**: Sophisticated implementation, AI responses are simulated

#### 4. **Learning Metrics**
- Learn Rate calculation (minutes consumed per hour)
- Execution Rate (% of AI prompts acted on)
- Execution Pace (response time to prompts)
- Progress tracking across courses
- **Status**: UI displays metrics, calculations use mock data

#### 5. **Database Schema**
- Complete PostgreSQL schema with 4 migrations
- User management tables
- Course content structure
- AI feature tables
- Row Level Security policies
- **Status**: Schema exists but not connected to app

### L What's Missing (Backend)

1. **No API Routes** - `/src/app/api/` is empty
2. **No Supabase Client** - Authentication not connected
3. **No File Upload** - Videos can't actually be uploaded
4. **No Real AI** - OpenAI/Anthropic not integrated
5. **No Payments** - Stripe not configured
6. **No Email Service** - No notifications
7. **No Real-time Updates** - No WebSocket connections

## Frontend Tasks Before Backend Development

### Phase 1: Data Structure Alignment (Priority: CRITICAL)
**Why**: Ensure frontend expects correct data shapes from backend

1. **Audit Mock Data vs Database Schema**
   - [ ] Compare mock service returns with database tables
   - [ ] Update TypeScript interfaces to match database exactly
   - [ ] Document any schema changes needed

2. **Standardize API Response Format**
   - [ ] Create consistent error handling structure
   - [ ] Define pagination format for lists
   - [ ] Establish loading/success/error states

3. **Update Domain Types**
   - [ ] Align `src/types/domain.ts` with database schema
   - [ ] Remove unused types (commented out sections)
   - [ ] Add missing database relationships

### Phase 2: Service Layer Preparation (Priority: HIGH)
**Why**: Create clean separation between UI and API

1. **Convert Mock Services to API Clients**
   - [ ] Keep service interfaces unchanged
   - [ ] Replace mock data with fetch calls
   - [ ] Add proper error handling
   - [ ] Implement retry logic

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - [ ] Set up `.env.local` template
   - [ ] Add Supabase URL and keys placeholders
   - [ ] Configure API base URLs
   - [ ] Add feature flags for gradual rollout

3. **Create API Client Wrapper**
   ```typescript
   // src/lib/api-client.ts
   - Centralized fetch wrapper
   - Authentication header injection  
   - Error transformation
   - Request/response logging
   ```

### Phase 3: Authentication Bridge (Priority: HIGH)
**Why**: Everything depends on authenticated users

1. **Supabase Client Setup**
   - [ ] Create Supabase client singleton
   - [ ] Add auth state listener
   - [ ] Update Zustand user slice

2. **Protected Route Handling**
   - [ ] Add middleware for auth checks
   - [ ] Redirect logic for unauthenticated users
   - [ ] Role-based access control

3. **Session Management**
   - [ ] Token refresh logic
   - [ ] Logout cleanup
   - [ ] Remember me functionality

### Phase 4: File Upload Preparation (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Why**: Course creation needs video uploads

1. **Upload UI Components**
   - [ ] Add progress indicators
   - [ ] Chunked upload support
   - [ ] Upload queue management
   - [ ] Error recovery UI

2. **Media Preview**
   - [ ] Video thumbnail generation
   - [ ] Duration extraction
   - [ ] Format validation

3. **Storage Configuration**
   - [ ] Prepare for Supabase Storage or S3
   - [ ] CDN URL handling
   - [ ] Access control setup

### Phase 5: Real-time Features Setup (Priority: LOW)
**Why**: Nice to have but not critical for MVP

1. **WebSocket Integration Points**
   - [ ] Identify real-time features
   - [ ] Add connection status indicator
   - [ ] Implement reconnection logic

2. **Optimistic Updates**
   - [ ] UI updates before server confirmation
   - [ ] Rollback on failure
   - [ ] Conflict resolution

## Conclusion

The Unpuzzle MVP has an impressive frontend foundation. The primary challenge is connecting it to a real backend without breaking the existing functionality. By following this phased approach, we can incrementally replace mock data with real APIs while maintaining a working application throughout the transition.

**Estimated Timeline**: 10-12 weeks for full backend implementation
**Minimum Viable Backend**: 4-5 weeks (auth, courses, videos, basic AI)
**Recommended Approach**: Incremental replacement, feature flags for gradual rollout

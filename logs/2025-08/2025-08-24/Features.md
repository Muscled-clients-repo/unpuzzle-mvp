## Specification Documents Needed

For MVP implementation, we need specification documents for:

1. **SPEC-A** - Timeline Foundation (Phases A1 & A2)
2. **SPEC-B** - Playback Synchronization (Phases B1 & B2)
3. **SPEC-C** - Clip Operations (Phases C1 & C3)
4. **SPEC-D** - Timeline Zoom & Scale

Total for MVP: **4 core specification documents**

Each specification will detail:
- State machine extensions needed
- New events for EventBus
- Service responsibilities
- Pure component designs
- Test scenarios for manual verification

## üéØ **Final Recommendation**

**Go with $497/month single tier pricing.** Your assets are worth far more than $197/month, and premium pricing will attract higher-quality members who get better results and provide better testimonials.

**Two landing pages** with track differentiation, but **same pricing** for both. This simplifies operations while allowing personalized positioning.

**Focus on first 30 days** getting 30-40 members for $15k-$20k MRR, then optimize for sustainable growth to 100 members and $50k+ MRR by year-end.

Your combination of proven systems + real assets + live building access is incredibly valuable. Price it accordingly and watch serious entrepreneurs gladly invest in their transformation.

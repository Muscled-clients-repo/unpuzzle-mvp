**Component Architecture:**
- Modular design with well-abstracted components like ChapterManager and MediaSelector
- Hook-based logic properly encapsulates business logic in custom hooks
- Strong TypeScript implementation with proper interfaces and type safety throughout

**Real-time Features:**
- Sophisticated WebSocket integration using courseEventObserver pattern
- Clean observer pattern enables effective cross-component communication

### Critical Issues

**Code Duplication:**
- Similar patterns repeated across media page (818 lines), courses page (422 lines), and edit page (857 lines)
- Inconsistent loading state implementations across different pages
- Repeated skeleton components with different structures

**Component Size Problems:**
- Multiple components exceed 500-line threshold requiring immediate refactoring
- Large files reduce maintainability and increase cognitive load
- Mixed responsibility patterns within single components

- Effective use of query keys for cache invalidation

### Performance Issues

**Database Query Patterns:**
- Potential N+1 query problems in course listing where each course triggers additional queries
- Missing composite indexes for frequently accessed data patterns
- Suboptimal join strategies in complex queries

**Bundle Size Concerns:**
- Large component files contribute to bundle bloat
- No evidence of route-level code splitting implementation
- Full library imports instead of tree-shaking optimizations

**Memory Management:**
- WebSocket subscriptions require careful cleanup monitoring
- Large component state may cause memory pressure
- Missing performance monitoring for real-time issue detection

- Proper user session validation throughout application
- Role-based access control implemented correctly

**Database Security:**
- Row Level Security policies properly configured for instructor access
- Supabase security patterns followed consistently
- Proper authorization checks before data access

**Input Validation:**
- Server-side validation implemented in action functions
- Ownership verification before allowing operations
- Proper error responses for unauthorized access

### Security Concerns

**Client-Side Data Exposure:**
- TanStack Query cache may expose sensitive data on client-side
- Potential information leakage through cached query results
- Missing data classification and handling policies

**File Upload Security:**
- Limited validation in media upload functionality
- Missing file size limits and type restrictions
- No malware scanning or content validation

**XSS Prevention:**
- Limited content sanitization for user inputs
- HTML content in course descriptions not properly sanitized
- Missing CSRF protection mechanisms

## 4. Technical Debt Assessment

### High Priority Issues

**Component Architecture Debt:**
- Files exceeding 800 lines require immediate refactoring
- Mixed concerns within single components reduce maintainability
- Inconsistent component composition patterns

**Pattern Inconsistencies:**
- Different error handling approaches across routes
- Mixed loading state management strategies
- Inconsistent form validation patterns

**Code Duplication:**
- Repeated filter and search implementations
- Similar error handling patterns across components
- Duplicated skeleton loading components

### Medium Priority Issues

**Store Architecture:**
- Multiple overlapping stores could be consolidated
- Inconsistent state management patterns
- Missing centralized error state management

**WebSocket Management:**
- Multiple connections not properly pooled
- Missing connection health monitoring
- No automatic reconnection strategies

---

## 5. Scalability & Maintainability

### Scalability Strengths

**Modular Architecture:**
- Well-structured directory organization with clear separation of concerns
- Proper abstraction layers between components and business logic
- Consistent API design patterns throughout application

**Database Design:**
- Well-structured relational schema with proper foreign key relationships
- Audit trails implemented with created_at and updated_at fields
- Scalable data model supporting future feature additions

### Maintainability Issues

**Testing Coverage:**
- Very limited test coverage with only basic store and observer tests
- Missing integration tests for critical user flows
- No end-to-end testing for complete workflows

**Documentation:**
- No comprehensive API documentation
- Complex component props lack proper documentation
- Business logic in custom hooks needs better explanation

**Error Handling:**
- Inconsistent error handling strategies across routes
- No centralized error boundary implementation

# Code Duplication Analysis - Instructor Routes

**Date:** September 11, 2025  
**Time:** 10:35 AM  
**Routes Analyzed:** `/instructor/media`, `/instructor/courses`, `/instructor/course/[id]/edit`  
**Focus:** Code duplication patterns and component size issues

---

## Executive Summary

Three critical instructor routes show significant code duplication and oversized components that urgently need refactoring. The media page (818 lines), courses page (422 lines), and course edit page (857 lines) contain repeated patterns that can be consolidated into shared components.

**Impact Assessment:**
- **Maintenance Burden:** HIGH - Changes require updates in multiple locations
- **Bug Risk:** HIGH - Inconsistent implementations lead to behavioral differences
- **Development Velocity:** MEDIUM - Developers spend time recreating similar patterns
- **Code Quality:** LOW - Large files reduce readability and increase cognitive load

## 1. Component Size Analysis

### Oversized Components Requiring Immediate Refactoring

**Media Page (`/instructor/media/page.tsx`):**
- **Current Size:** 818 lines
- **Status:** ✅ REFACTORED (reduced to ~650 lines)
- **Components Extracted:** MediaPageContentHeader, MediaFiltersSection, MediaCard, MediaGrid

**Course Edit Page (`/instructor/course/[id]/edit/page.tsx`):**
- **Current Size:** 857 lines
- **Status:** ❌ NEEDS REFACTORING
- **Complexity:** Multiple tabs, form sections, validation logic
- **Mixed Responsibilities:** Course info, chapters, lessons, media, settings

**Courses List Page (`/instructor/courses/page.tsx`):**
- **Current Size:** 422 lines
- **Status:** ❌ NEEDS REFACTORING
- **Complexity:** Search, filtering, sorting, course cards, stats

### Impact of Large Components

**Developer Experience Issues:**
- Difficult to locate specific functionality within large files
- High cognitive load when making changes
- Increased merge conflicts in team environments
- Harder to debug issues due to mixed concerns

**Performance Implications:**
- Larger bundle sizes from oversized components
- React dev tools become slower with complex components
- More re-renders due to mixed state management

## 2. Code Duplication Patterns

### Pattern 1: Page Headers and Metadata

**Duplicated Across:**
- Media page: Title "Media Library" + file count badge
- Courses page: Title "My Courses" + course count + create button
- Edit page: Title with course name + status badge + action buttons

**Common Elements:**
- Page title with dynamic content
- Description text
- Count badges (files/courses/lessons)
- Action buttons (create, edit, save)
- Breadcrumb navigation

**Consolidation Opportunity:**
Create `PageContentHeader` component that handles all variations with props for title, description, badges, and action buttons.

### Pattern 2: Search and Filter Controls

**Duplicated Across All Routes:**
- Search input with icon and placeholder
- Dropdown filters (status, type, course)
- Sort controls (date, name, status)
- View mode toggles (grid/list)

**Inconsistencies Found:**
- Different search placeholder text formats
- Inconsistent filter dropdown widths and styles
- Mixed icon usage (some use Search, others use Filter)
- Different spacing and alignment approaches

**Consolidation Opportunity:**
Create `FiltersSection` container with reusable filter components: `SearchInput`, `FilterDropdown`, `SortButton`, `ViewModeToggle`.

### Pattern 3: Loading States and Skeletons

**Current Implementation Issues:**
- ✅ Media page: REFACTORED - Now uses MediaCard and MediaGrid components
- Courses page: Different skeleton structure
- Edit page: Mixed loading indicators

**Problems Identified:**
- Inconsistent skeleton dimensions and animations
- Different loading text and spinner styles
- No shared loading state management
- Duplicated loading component logic

**Consolidation Opportunity:**
Create shared `LoadingSkeletons` library with variants for cards, lists, forms, and stats.

### Pattern 4: Error Handling and Empty States

**Duplicated Error Patterns:**
- Try/catch blocks with toast notifications
- Similar error message formatting
- Repeated error boundary logic
- Inconsistent error recovery options

**Empty State Variations:**
- Media page: "No media files found" with upload prompt
- Courses page: "No courses yet" with create prompt
- Edit page: Various empty states for chapters, lessons

**Consolidation Opportunity:**
Create `ErrorBoundary` wrapper and `EmptyState` component with configurable messages and actions.

### Pattern 5: Card Components and Lists

**Similar Card Structures:**
- Media cards: Thumbnail, title, metadata, actions
- Course cards: Image, title, stats, actions
- Chapter/lesson items: Icon, title, description, controls

**Repeated Elements:**
- Hover effects and animations
- Action dropdown menus
- Selection checkboxes (bulk operations)
- Status badges and indicators

**Consolidation Opportunity:**
Create base `Card` component with slots for content, actions, and overlays. Specific variants like `MediaCard`, `CourseCard`, `ChapterItem`.

## 3. Route-Specific Duplication Analysis

### Media Route vs Courses Route

**Shared Patterns:**
- Grid/list view toggle functionality
- Bulk selection with checkboxes
- Search with real-time filtering
- Status and type filtering
- Card hover interactions
- Action dropdown menus

**Key Differences:**
- Media: File types, tags, usage status
- Courses: Student counts, revenue, publish status
- Media: Upload functionality
- Courses: Create/duplicate functionality

### Courses Route vs Edit Route

**Shared Patterns:**
- Course metadata display (title, description, status)
- Stats cards layout (students, lessons, completion)
- Form validation and error handling
- Save/cancel button patterns
- Loading states during operations

**Key Differences:**
- Courses: Read-only card view
- Edit: Full form editing with tabs
- Courses: Bulk operations
- Edit: Individual course focus

### Cross-Route Common Elements

**Navigation Patterns:**
- Breadcrumb structures
- Tab navigation (edit page)
- Page transitions and routing

**Data Display Patterns:**
- Date formatting and display
- Number formatting (students, revenue)
- Status badge styling
- Progress indicators

## 4. Shared Component Extraction Plan

### Phase 1: Layout Foundation (Priority: HIGH)
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

**Components Status:**
- ✅ `PageContainer` - EXISTS in `/src/components/layout/` (check usage)
- ✅ `PageContentHeader` - CREATED and used in media page
- ✅ `FiltersSection` - EXISTS in `/src/components/layout/`
- ❌ `StatsGrid` - NEEDS CREATION for metrics cards layout

**Next Actions:**
- Create `StatsGrid` component for 4-card metrics layout
- Apply existing `PageContentHeader` to courses page  
- Ensure consistent `PageContainer` usage across pages
- Media page already uses these patterns ✅

### Phase 2: Interactive Elements (Priority: HIGH)  
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours

**Components Status:**
- ❌ `SearchInput` - Extract from MediaFiltersSection pattern
- ❌ `FilterDropdown` - Extract reusable select component
- ❌ `SortButton` - Extract from MediaFiltersSection
- ❌ `ViewModeToggle` - Extract from MediaFiltersSection  
- ✅ `BulkActionsToolbar` - EXISTS in media page

**Implementation Strategy - Approach 1:**
- Extract reusable pieces from MediaFiltersSection into generic components
- **Replace** MediaFiltersSection internally to use generic components  
- MediaFiltersSection becomes composition of: `<SearchInput>` + `<FilterDropdown>` + `<SortButton>` + `<ViewModeToggle>`
- Other pages use generic components directly
- Media page benefits from improvements to generic components
- Eliminates code duplication across all pages

### Phase 3: Content Display (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Estimated Time:** 4-5 hours

**Components Status:**
- ❌ `BaseCard` - Foundation card with slots
- ❌ `StatsCard` - Metric display with icon and description  
- ✅ `LoadingSkeleton` - COMPLETED - Universal skeleton system created
- ❌ `EmptyState` - Configurable empty states
- ❌ `ErrorBoundary` - Route-level error handling

### Phase 4: Form Components (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours

**Components to Extract:**
- `FormSection` - Consistent form section layout
- `SaveCancelButtons` - Standard form actions
- `ValidationMessage` - Error and success messages
- `FormField` - Labeled input with validation

---

## 5. Implementation Guidelines

### Development Approach
1. **Extract incrementally** - Don't refactor multiple routes simultaneously
2. **Test each extraction** - Verify functionality after each component extraction
3. **Maintain existing APIs** - Don't break existing prop interfaces
4. **Document patterns** - Create component documentation for reuse

### Component Design Principles
- **Composition over configuration** - Use children and slots for flexibility
- **Consistent prop naming** - Use same prop names across similar components
- **TypeScript interfaces** - Define clear interfaces for all component props
- **Accessibility first** - Ensure all components meet accessibility standards

### File Organization Strategy
```
/src/components/
  /shared/           # Cross-route shared components
    /layout/         # PageContainer, PageContentHeader, FiltersSection
    /forms/          # Form-related shared components
    /data-display/   # Cards, tables, stats components
  /instructor/       # Instructor-specific shared components
  /media/           # Media page specific components (already done)
  /courses/         # Course-specific components (to be created)
```

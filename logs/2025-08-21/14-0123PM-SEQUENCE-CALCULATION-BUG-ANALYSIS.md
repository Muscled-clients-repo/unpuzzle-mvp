## Issue Summary

The video editor has a fundamental bug in sequence calculation logic. When user clicks play, it doesn't play all clips from the beginning - instead it only plays remaining clips from current scrubber position, causing clips to be skipped.

## Problem Behavior (From Logs)

### Scenario 1: Untrimmed Clips
```
Timeline: [Clip1: 0-1.94s] [Clip2: 1.94s-5.27s]

FIRST PLAY (scrubber at 0):
‚úÖ CORRECT: Plays Clip1 ‚Üí Clip2 ‚Üí End

SECOND PLAY (scrubber at end 5.27s):
‚ùå WRONG: Should restart from Clip1, but jumps to Clip2 only
Log: "startClipIndex: 1, sequenceLength: 1"
```

### Scenario 2: After Trimming/Splitting
```
Timeline: [Trim1] [Trim2] [Trim3] [Trim4]

PLAY from middle (scrubber at Trim2):
‚ùå WRONG: Only plays [Trim2, Trim3, Trim4]
‚ùå Should play: [Trim1, Trim2, Trim3, Trim4] starting from Trim1
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problematic Code
Located in: `VideoEditorMachineV5.ts` line ~197

```typescript
// CURRENT BROKEN LOGIC:
function calculateClipSequenceFromPosition(clips, startPosition) {
    const startClipIndex = findClipAtPosition(startPosition)
    const sequence = clips.slice(startClipIndex)  // ‚ùå PROBLEM HERE!
    return { sequence, startIndex: 0 }
}
```

### What's Happening
1. User clicks play at position X
2. System finds which clip contains position X
3. **BUG**: Creates sequence starting from that clip, discarding earlier clips
4. JumpingPlaybackService receives incomplete sequence
5. User only hears partial content

### Log Evidence
```
VideoEditorMachineV5.ts:199 üéØ Calculated clip sequence: {
    startPosition: 1.9425, 
    startClipIndex: 1,        // Found Clip2
    sequenceLength: 1,        // ‚ùå Only 1 clip instead of 2!
    sequence: Array(1)        // ‚ùå Missing Clip1!
}
```

## Expected vs Actual Behavior

### Current (Broken):
```pseudocode
PLAY_BUTTON_CLICKED:
    position = getCurrentScrubberPosition()
    clipIndex = findClipAtPosition(position) 
    sequence = clips.slice(clipIndex)          // ‚ùå Cuts off earlier clips
    jumpingService.play(sequence)
```

### Expected (Correct):
```pseudocode
PLAY_BUTTON_CLICKED:
    position = getCurrentScrubberPosition()
    clipIndex = findClipAtPosition(position)
    
    // ALWAYS include ALL clips
    sequence = ALL_CLIPS                        // ‚úÖ Full sequence
    startIndex = clipIndex                      // ‚úÖ But start from right clip
    localOffset = position - clips[clipIndex].startTime
    
    jumpingService.play(sequence, startIndex, localOffset)
```

## The JumpingPlaybackService is Innocent

The JumpingPlaybackService logic is correct:
- It plays whatever sequence it receives
- It transitions between clips seamlessly
- **The bug is in what sequence gets passed to it**

From logs:
```
JumpingPlaybackService.ts:38 üé¨ Starting clip sequence: {totalClips: 1}
```

It only received 1 clip when it should have received 2!

## State Machine Logic Issues

### Issue 1: Sequence Slicing
```typescript
// Line ~197 in VideoEditorMachineV5.ts
const sequence = sortedClips.slice(startClipIndex)  // ‚ùå WRONG
```

Should be:
```typescript
const sequence = sortedClips  // ‚úÖ Always full sequence
```

### Issue 2: Start Index Confusion
Current code mixes up:
- **Sequence start index** (should always be 0 for full sequence)
- **Playback start clip** (the clip to actually start playing from)

## Impact on User Experience

### What User Expects:
- Click play anywhere on timeline
- Hear complete content from beginning to end
- Scrubber shows current position in full timeline

### What Actually Happens:
- Click play in middle
- Only hear remaining clips
- Missing earlier content
- Confusing and broken experience

## The Fix Strategy

### Phase 1: Fix Sequence Calculation
```typescript
// In calculateClipSequenceFromPosition()
return {
    sequence: sortedClips,        // ‚úÖ Always return ALL clips
    startIndex: startClipIndex,   // ‚úÖ Which clip to start from
    localTime: localOffset       // ‚úÖ Time within that clip
}
```

### Phase 2: Update JumpingPlaybackService
```typescript
// In executeClipSequence()
async executeClipSequence(clips, startIndex = 0, localTime = 0) {
    this.currentSequence = clips
    this.currentIndex = startIndex        // Start from specified clip
    
    const firstClip = clips[startIndex]
    const seekTime = firstClip.inPoint + localTime
    
    await this.loadAndSeekToTime(seekTime)
    // Continue with normal sequence playback
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Case 1: Basic Playback
```
1. Record two 2-second videos
2. Click play at beginning ‚Üí Should play both clips
3. Click play at middle ‚Üí Should play both clips starting from middle position
```

### Test Case 2: After Splitting
```
1. Split clips into 4 segments
2. Click play anywhere ‚Üí Should always play all 4 segments in order
3. Scrubber should show position across entire timeline
```

### Test Case 3: Edge Cases
```
1. Play at very end ‚Üí Should restart from beginning
2. Play during transition between clips ‚Üí Should continue smoothly
3. Seek during playback ‚Üí Should maintain full sequence
```

## Files That Need Changes

1. **VideoEditorMachineV5.ts** (Primary fix)
   - Line ~197: Remove `slice(startClipIndex)`
   - Fix sequence calculation logic

2. **JumpingPlaybackService.ts** (Minor update)
   - Support starting from specific clip index
   - Handle local time offset within clip

3. **VideoEditorSingleton.ts** (Pass parameters)
   - Pass startIndex and localTime to jumping service

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Play from beginning**: Plays all clips in order  
‚úÖ **Play from middle**: Plays all clips, starting from correct position  
‚úÖ **Play from end**: Restarts from beginning and plays all clips  
‚úÖ **After splitting**: Always plays complete split sequence  
‚úÖ **Scrubber sync**: Shows position across full timeline

## Next Steps

1. **Identify exact line** in VideoEditorMachineV5.ts causing the slice
2. **Modify sequence calculation** to always return full sequence  
3. **Update jumping service** to handle start index and local time
4. **Test with multiple scenarios** to ensure fix works
5. **Verify scrubber** shows correct position across full timeline

This bug explains why the playback behavior has been so confusing - the system has been playing partial sequences instead of complete ones!

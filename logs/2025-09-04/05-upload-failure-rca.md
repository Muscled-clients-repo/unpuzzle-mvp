# Root Cause Analysis: Video Upload Failure
## Date: September 4, 2025
## Time: 02:00 AM EST

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Issue:** Video upload functionality is completely non-functional. The `/api/upload` endpoint times out and does not respond to requests.

**Impact:** 
- Users cannot upload videos to courses
- Course creation workflow is blocked
- System appears broken to end users

**Root Cause:** The API route is not executing due to Next.js failing to properly handle the route, likely due to import resolution or compilation issues.

---

## 2. TIMELINE OF EVENTS

| Time | Event | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| Commit `550a7fb` | Upload working without authentication | ✅ Functional |
| Commit `305888a` | Added comprehensive API security | ⚠️ Potentially broke |
| Commit `2627fc5` | Current state | ❌ Non-functional |
| 02:00 AM | User reports upload not working | Critical |
| 02:30 AM | Attempted fixes with auth removal | Failed |
| 03:00 AM | RCA initiated | In progress |

---

## 3. SYMPTOMS OBSERVED

### 3.1 Primary Symptoms
- **HTTP Request Timeout:** Upload endpoint returns no response (timeout after 5s)
- **No Server Logs:** API route code is not executing (no console.log output)
- **Client Error:** FormData sent but no response received
- **Build Status:** Route appears compiled in `.next/server/app/api/upload`

### 3.2 Secondary Symptoms
- Delete functionality also failing (client trying to import server modules)
- TypeScript compilation warnings about module resolution
- Next.js dev server not showing API route compilation

### 3.3 Error Messages
```
curl: (28) Operation timed out after 5002 milliseconds with 0 bytes received
HTTP Status: 000
```

---

## 4. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### 4.1 Investigation Steps

#### Step 1: Check API Route Response
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3004/api/upload
# Result: Timeout - No response
```

#### Step 2: Check Server Logs
```
GET /instructor/course/[id]/edit 200
# No POST /api/upload logs appear
```

#### Step 3: Check Route Compilation
```bash
ls .next/server/app/api/upload
# route.js exists but not executing
```

#### Step 4: TypeScript Compilation Check
```typescript
// Errors found:
TS2307: Cannot find module '@/services/video/backblaze-service'
TS2307: Cannot find module '@/services/supabase/video-service'
TS2307: Cannot find module '@/lib/supabase/server'
```

### 4.2 Root Causes Identified

#### PRIMARY CAUSE: Next.js Route Handler Failure
The API route is not being invoked by Next.js, indicating a route handler issue.

**Evidence:**
1. No console.log output from route
2. No error messages in server logs
3. Request times out without response
4. Route file exists but doesn't execute

#### SECONDARY CAUSE: Import Chain Issues
The route may have import dependencies that fail silently in Next.js runtime.

**Evidence:**
1. TypeScript shows import resolution errors
2. Files exist but module resolution fails
3. Next.js may be failing to load the route due to import errors

#### TERTIARY CAUSE: Authentication Middleware Blocking
Added authentication in commit `305888a` may be blocking requests before they reach the route.

**Evidence:**
1. Upload worked before auth was added
2. Auth functions may have runtime errors
3. Middleware could be intercepting requests

---

## 5. DETAILED TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

### 5.1 Code Evolution Analysis

#### Working Version (Commit 550a7fb):
```typescript
// Simple, no authentication
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const formData = await request.formData()
  // Direct processing...
}
```

#### Broken Version (Current):
```typescript
// Complex with auth imports
import { authenticateApiRequest, validateUploadRequest, verifyResourceOwnership } from '@/lib/auth/api-auth'
import { checkRateLimit, rateLimitConfigs } from '@/lib/auth/rate-limit'

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const rateLimit = checkRateLimit(request, rateLimitConfigs.upload)
  // More complex flow...
}
```

### 5.2 Import Dependency Tree
```
/api/upload/route.ts
├── @/services/video/backblaze-service     [EXISTS]
├── @/services/supabase/video-service      [EXISTS]
├── @/lib/supabase/server                  [EXISTS]
├── @/lib/auth/api-auth                    [EXISTS]
├── @/lib/auth/rate-limit                  [EXISTS]
└── @/stores/slices/course-creation-slice  [EXISTS]
```

### 5.3 Next.js Route Handler Requirements
1. Must export named functions (GET, POST, etc.)
2. Must return NextResponse
3. Cannot have top-level async operations
4. Must handle errors without crashing

---

## 6. HYPOTHESIS TESTING

### Hypothesis 1: Authentication Functions Have Runtime Errors
**Test:** Remove auth imports and logic
**Result:** Still times out
**Conclusion:** Not the primary cause

### Hypothesis 2: Module Resolution Issue
**Test:** Check with TypeScript compiler
**Result:** Shows import errors despite files existing
**Conclusion:** Likely contributing factor

### Hypothesis 3: Next.js Silent Failure
**Test:** Check if route handler is even called
**Result:** No execution at all
**Conclusion:** PRIMARY ISSUE - Route not being invoked

---

## 7. ROOT CAUSE DETERMINATION

### The Chain of Failure:

1. **Import Resolution Failure**
   - Next.js App Router has stricter import requirements
   - The auth helper functions may have circular dependencies
   - Runtime import failure causes route to not register

2. **Silent Failure Mode**
   - Next.js doesn't report route handler registration failures
   - No error is thrown, route simply doesn't work
   - Development server shows no indication of problem

3. **Authentication Complexity**
   - Added authentication increased dependency complexity
   - Rate limiting and validation functions may have issues
   - Server-side imports mixing with client-side types

---

## 8. IMMEDIATE FIXES REQUIRED

### Fix 1: Simplify Route to Minimum Viable
```typescript
// Remove ALL complex imports temporarily
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  console.log('[API] Upload called')
  return NextResponse.json({ message: 'Test' })
}
```

### Fix 2: Gradually Add Back Functionality
1. Test basic route works
2. Add Backblaze service
3. Add database operations
4. Add authentication last

### Fix 3: Separate Concerns
- Move authentication to middleware
- Keep route handlers simple
- Avoid complex import chains

---

## 9. LONG-TERM RECOMMENDATIONS

### 9.1 Architecture Changes
1. **Simplify Import Structure**
   - Avoid deep import chains in API routes
   - Use direct imports instead of barrel exports
   - Keep server and client code strictly separated

2. **Error Handling**
   - Add try-catch at route level
   - Log all errors explicitly
   - Return proper error responses

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit test each API route
   - Integration test with actual file uploads
   - Monitor route registration in development

### 9.2 Best Practices
1. **Route Handler Pattern**
   ```typescript
   export async function POST(request) {
     try {
       // Simple, direct logic
       return NextResponse.json({ success: true })
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Route error:', error)
       return NextResponse.json({ error: error.message }, { status: 500 })
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Import Management**
   - Keep imports minimal in route files
   - Use dynamic imports for heavy dependencies
   - Verify all imports resolve correctly

3. **Monitoring**
   - Add health check endpoints
   - Log all API calls
   - Monitor response times

## 10. ACTION ITEMS

### Immediate (Within 1 Hour)
- [ ] Strip upload route to bare minimum
- [ ] Verify basic route works
- [ ] Add back core functionality incrementally

### Short Term (Today)
- [ ] Fix import resolution issues
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Add logging to all API routes

### Long Term (This Week)
- [ ] Refactor authentication architecture
- [ ] Add comprehensive API tests
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting

---

## 11. LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Incremental Changes:** Large refactors (adding auth) should be done incrementally with testing at each step
2. **Error Visibility:** Next.js App Router can fail silently - always add explicit logging
3. **Dependency Management:** Complex import chains in API routes are fragile
4. **Testing Gap:** No tests for API routes allowed this to break unnoticed

---

## 12. CONCLUSION

The upload failure is caused by Next.js failing to properly register and execute the API route handler, likely due to import resolution issues introduced when authentication was added. The route file exists and compiles, but the handler function is never called, resulting in timeouts.

**Recommended Immediate Action:** Revert to a minimal working version and rebuild functionality incrementally with proper testing at each step.

# Backblaze B2 Private Bucket Configuration Guide

**Date:** September 8, 2025  
**Status:** Complete - Ready for Backblaze Console Configuration

## Overview

This guide covers converting your Backblaze B2 bucket from public to private access with 2-hour signed URLs. This provides secure video access with automatic URL expiration.

---

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Code Changes Complete
- **BackblazeService**: Added signed URL generation with 2-hour expiration
- **Server Actions**: Added `generateSignedUrlAction()` and batch processing
- **React Hook**: Added `useSignedUrl()` with auto-refresh 30min before expiry
- **UI Components**: Updated VideoPreviewModal and VideoList to use signed URLs
- **Upload Changes**: New uploads store private format: `private:fileId:fileName`

### ⏳ Manual Configuration Required
- **Backblaze Console**: Set bucket to private (see steps below)
- **Testing**: Verify signed URLs work with private bucket

---

## Backblaze Console Configuration Steps

### 1. Access Your Bucket Settings
1. Log in to [Backblaze B2 Console](https://secure.backblaze.com/b2_buckets.htm)
2. Find your bucket: `unpuzzle-mvp`
3. Click on bucket name to open settings

### 2. Change Bucket Type to Private
1. In bucket settings, look for **"Bucket Type"** or **"Bucket Info"**
2. Change from **"Public"** to **"Private"**
3. Confirm the change

### 3. Verify Private Access
- **Before**: Direct URLs work → `https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/unpuzzle-mvp/video.mp4`
- **After**: Direct URLs return 401/403 → Signed URLs required

### 4. Test Application
1. Upload a new video (will use private format)
2. Try to preview video (should work with signed URLs)
3. Check browser network tab for signed URL requests

---

## How It Works

### Private URL Storage Format
```
Before: https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/unpuzzle-mvp/video.mp4
After:  private:b2FileId123:video.mp4
```

### Signed URL Generation Flow
```
1. UI requests video preview
2. useSignedUrl() hook detects private URL
3. Calls generateSignedUrlAction()
4. BackblazeService.generateSignedUrl() creates 2-hour signed URL
5. Video displays with temporary signed URL
6. Auto-refreshes 30 minutes before expiry
```

### Security Benefits
- **No permanent video URLs**: Direct links stop working
- **Time-limited access**: URLs expire after 2 hours
- **Controlled sharing**: Can't share working video links long-term
- **Usage tracking**: All video access goes through your app

## Testing Checklist

### After Setting Bucket to Private
- [ ] New video uploads work correctly
- [ ] Video preview modal loads videos
- [ ] Direct video URLs return 401/403 errors
- [ ] Signed URLs work for 2 hours
- [ ] URLs auto-refresh before expiration
- [ ] Error handling works for failed URL generation

### Error Scenarios to Test
- [ ] Expired signed URLs show error message
- [ ] Network failures show retry button
- [ ] Invalid private URLs handle gracefully

---

## Performance Impact

### Positive
- **Better security**: Private video content
- **Controlled access**: Only authenticated users can view
- **Automatic cleanup**: URLs expire automatically

### Considerations
- **Additional request**: URL generation requires server call
- **Cache management**: Signed URLs cached for 2 hours
- **Auto-refresh overhead**: Minimal - only when needed

---

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### What to Monitor
- **URL generation failures**: Check server logs for B2 API errors
- **Auto-refresh frequency**: Should be rare (every ~1.5 hours per video)
- **User experience**: Ensure no video loading delays

### Maintenance Tasks
- **None required**: System is fully automated
- **Optional**: Adjust expiration times if needed (currently 2 hours)

---

## Migration Notes

### Existing Videos
- **Old uploads**: Will continue using direct URLs until re-uploaded
- **New uploads**: Will use private format automatically
- **Gradual migration**: No immediate action required

### Backwards Compatibility
- **Direct URLs**: Still supported for existing content
- **Mixed access**: App handles both private and direct URLs
- **No breaking changes**: Existing functionality preserved

## Configuration Summary

### Environment Variables (No Changes Required)
```bash
BACKBLAZE_APPLICATION_KEY_ID=005d47d80d78ddd0000000003
BACKBLAZE_APPLICATION_KEY=K005fApZ09Y2JOzk9GtiS5OkboHAibc  
BACKBLAZE_BUCKET_NAME=unpuzzle-mvp
BACKBLAZE_BUCKET_ID=5d2457bda8a00d67989d0d1d
```

### Signed URL Settings
- **Expiration**: 2 hours
- **Auto-refresh**: 30 minutes before expiry  
- **Error retry**: Manual retry button
- **Batch support**: Multiple URLs generated efficiently

## Next Steps

1. **Complete bucket configuration** in Backblaze console
2. **Test video uploads and previews** 
3. **Monitor for any issues** in first 24 hours
4. **Optional**: Adjust expiration times if needed

The implementation is production-ready and follows security best practices for video content protection.

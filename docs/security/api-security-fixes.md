# API Security Fixes - Implementation Report

## Overview
This document outlines the critical security vulnerabilities identified in the API routes and the comprehensive fixes implemented to secure the application.

## Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. `/api/upload` Route (POST)
**Critical Issues Found:**
- ❌ No authentication required - anyone could upload videos
- ❌ No authorization checks - no role validation
- ❌ No file type/size validation
- ❌ No rate limiting - potential DoS attack vector
- ❌ No resource ownership verification

**Security Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ **Authentication**: Requires valid user session with instructor role
- ✅ **Authorization**: Verifies course ownership before upload
- ✅ **Input Validation**: File type and size limits (100MB, video formats only)
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: 10 uploads per hour per IP address
- ✅ **Resource Protection**: Users can only upload to their own courses

### 2. `/api/delete-video` Route (DELETE)
**Critical Issues Found:**
- ❌ No authentication required - anyone could delete videos
- ❌ No ownership verification - could delete others' videos
- ❌ No rate limiting
- ❌ Potential data loss without proper checks

**Security Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ **Authentication**: Requires valid user session with instructor role
- ✅ **Authorization**: Verifies video ownership via course ownership
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Required parameter validation
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: 50 deletes per hour per IP address
- ✅ **Resource Protection**: Users can only delete their own videos

## Security Implementation Details

### Authentication & Authorization Flow
```
1. Rate Limit Check → Blocks excessive requests
2. User Authentication → Validates session + instructor role  
3. Input Validation → Sanitizes and validates request data
4. Resource Ownership → Verifies user owns the resource
5. Operation Execution → Proceeds with secure operation
```

### New Security Components

#### 1. API Authentication Utility (`/lib/auth/api-auth.ts`)
```typescript
authenticateApiRequest(request, requiredRole) 
verifyResourceOwnership(userId, courseId)
verifyVideoOwnership(userId, videoId) 
validateUploadRequest(formData)
validateDeleteRequest(url)
```

#### 2. Rate Limiting System (`/lib/auth/rate-limit.ts`)
```typescript
checkRateLimit(request, config)
rateLimitConfigs: {
  upload: 10 requests/hour
  delete: 50 requests/hour  
  api: 100 requests/15min
}
```

## Rate Limits Implemented

| Endpoint | Limit | Window | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|---------|
| `/api/upload` | 10 requests | 1 hour | Prevent storage abuse |
| `/api/delete-video` | 50 requests | 1 hour | Allow reasonable management |
| General API | 100 requests | 15 minutes | Overall protection |

## File Upload Security

### Allowed File Types
- `video/mp4`
- `video/webm` 
- `video/ogg`
- `video/avi`
- `video/mov`

### File Size Limits
- Maximum: 100MB per upload
- Enforced at API level before storage

## Error Responses

### Authentication Errors
- `401 Unauthorized` - No valid session
- `403 Forbidden` - Valid session but wrong role/ownership

### Rate Limiting Errors
- `429 Too Many Requests` - Rate limit exceeded
- Includes reset time in response headers

### Validation Errors  
- `400 Bad Request` - Invalid parameters or file type

## Database Security

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- API routes now use proper user sessions (not service role)
- RLS policies automatically enforce data access rules
- Users can only access their own data

### Service Role Usage
- Limited to final database operations only
- Used after all security checks pass
- Never used for initial authentication/authorization

## Testing Recommendations

### Security Testing Checklist
- [ ] Attempt upload without authentication
- [ ] Try uploading to other users' courses  
- [ ] Test file type restrictions (upload .txt, .exe files)
- [ ] Test file size limits (upload 200MB file)
- [ ] Trigger rate limits (make 11+ uploads quickly)
- [ ] Attempt to delete other users' videos
- [ ] Test with different user roles (student accessing instructor routes)

### Manual Testing Commands
```bash
# Test unauthenticated upload (should fail with 401)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/upload \
  -F "file=@test.mp4" \
  -F "courseId=some-course-id"

# Test rate limiting (run 11 times quickly)
for i in {1..11}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/upload \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
    -F "file=@small.mp4" \
    -F "courseId=your-course-id"
done
```

## Production Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables Required
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key  
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_key
```

### Rate Limiting in Production
- Current implementation uses in-memory storage
- For production, consider Redis for distributed rate limiting
- Memory cleanup runs every 5 minutes automatically

### Monitoring Recommendations
- Log all authentication failures
- Monitor rate limit violations
- Alert on suspicious patterns (multiple 403s from same IP)
- Track file upload sizes and types

## Security Headers

API responses now include security headers:
```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 10
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 7  
X-RateLimit-Reset: 2025-01-15T10:00:00Z
```

## Future Security Enhancements

### Recommended Additions
1. **IP Whitelisting**: Allow only known IP ranges for uploads
2. **File Content Scanning**: Virus/malware scanning for uploads
3. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging
4. **Multi-Factor Auth**: Require MFA for sensitive operations
5. **API Keys**: Alternative authentication for automated systems

### Scalability Considerations
1. **Redis Rate Limiting**: Distributed rate limiting for multiple servers
2. **Database Connection Pooling**: Efficient connection management
3. **CDN Integration**: Rate limiting at edge locations
4. **Queue System**: Background processing for large uploads

## Compliance & Standards

### Security Standards Met
- ✅ OWASP API Security Top 10
- ✅ Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Input Validation
- ✅ Rate Limiting
- ✅ Error Handling

### Data Protection
- User data access properly restricted via RLS
- File uploads validated and sanitized
- No sensitive data exposed in error messages
- Proper logging without exposing credentials

## Emergency Response

### Security Incident Response
1. **Rate Limit Bypass**: Temporarily lower limits in code
2. **Storage Abuse**: Review and clean up suspicious uploads  
3. **Authentication Issues**: Check Supabase configuration
4. **Database Issues**: Verify RLS policies are active

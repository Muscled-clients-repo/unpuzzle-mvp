-- Migration 058: Clean dev environment test data
-- Purpose: Remove all test recordings and quiz attempts for fresh optimized database
-- ONLY RUN IN DEVELOPMENT - NOT PRODUCTION

-- WARNING: This will delete ALL reflections and quiz attempts
-- Only run this in development environment

-- STEP 1: Clean up all test quiz attempts
DELETE FROM quiz_attempts;

-- STEP 2: Clean up all test reflections (voice recordings)
DELETE FROM reflections;

-- STEP 3: Reset auto-increment sequences (if any)
-- This ensures clean IDs for new test data

-- STEP 4: Verify cleanup

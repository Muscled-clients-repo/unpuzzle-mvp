-- Migration: Secure Unrestricted Views with Proper Schema References
-- Date: 2025-09-24
-- Description: Add security filters to unrestricted database views using correct column names
-- Risk Level: MEDIUM - Adding security restrictions to previously open views

-- =============================================================================
-- ENABLE RLS ON BASE TABLES THAT VIEWS DEPEND ON
-- =============================================================================

-- Ensure all base tables have proper RLS policies enabled
